# Who Gets Rich From Stablecoin Regulation

The GENIUS Act passed the Senate Banking Committee in March 2025 with an 18-6 vote. Five Democrats crossed over. I've been reading the actual bill text, and the thing that jumped out wasn't the reserve requirements or the state-vs-federal licensing structure. It was section 4(a)(2): issuers with more than $10 billion in outstanding stablecoins must obtain a federal charter.

That's Tether and Circle. Nobody else is close.

I spent the week mapping out who actually benefits from this. The answer isn't who you'd expect.

### The $10 billion line

The threshold creates a two-tier market. Below $10 billion, state-chartered issuers operate under existing state money transmitter frameworks — the same licenses PayPal and Square hold. Above it, you need a federal charter from the OCC, full bank-level supervision, and reserves held in insured depository institutions or short-duration Treasuries.

Circle already has this. BNY Mellon custodies their reserves. BlackRock manages the Circle Reserve Fund. They're already spending $908 million a year on Coinbase distribution fees — 54% of revenue. The compliance cost is baked in.

Tether doesn't. $192 billion in reserves, mostly T-bills, but custodied through Cantor Fitzgerald and a network of non-US counterparties. No US banking relationship. No federal charter.

Here's what I didn't expect: Tether probably doesn't need one.

### The offshore gap

Section 5 covers "foreign stablecoin issuers." The requirements are lighter: register with FinCEN, maintain comparable reserves, submit to annual audits. But the enforcement mechanism is on US exchanges, not on Tether itself. US platforms that list non-compliant foreign stablecoins face penalties.

So Tether's real regulatory question isn't "can we get a federal charter?" It's "will Coinbase and Kraken keep listing USDT?"

Coinbase already delisted USDT in Europe after MiCA. But Tether's volume runs through Binance — 38% of global spot volume — and Tron-based OTC desks serving emerging markets. Only 11% of USDT volume touches US-regulated exchanges. The bill's enforcement mechanism has a structural gap you could drive $192 billion through.

I was wrong about this being existential for Tether. It's a mild inconvenience.

### Where the money actually moves

The interesting second-order effect isn't about Tether or Circle at all.

It's about custodians.

BNY Mellon manages $46.7 trillion in assets under custody. They started custodying crypto in 2022 — Bitcoin and Ether initially. Now they're positioning for stablecoin reserves. The GENIUS Act requires reserves in "insured depository institutions," which means traditional banks get a guaranteed role in every compliant stablecoin's infrastructure. State Street and Northern Trust are building the same capabilities. JPMorgan's custody arm — which already handles tri-party repo for most of the Treasury market — is the obvious third.

The fee structure is worth understanding. Custodying $50 billion in T-bills for a stablecoin issuer generates roughly $15-25 million annually in custody fees. Low margin on its own. But it's risk-free revenue attached to a market growing 40% year over year, and it comes with the relationship: once you custody someone's reserves, you're deeply embedded in their operations. Which is exactly where banks want to be.

Then there's the charter angle. The bill creates a new "payment stablecoin issuer" charter. Banks can issue stablecoins directly. JPMorgan already runs JPM Coin — rebranded to Kinexys, processing $2 billion per day for institutional clients. Citi and Bank of America both have blockchain payment pilots. The GENIUS Act gives them legal framework to issue dollar stablecoins competing directly with USDC.

Which is probably why Circle pushed so hard for this bill. And probably why it might backfire.

### The bank stablecoin problem

Circle lobbied for stablecoin regulation starting in 2021. The logic made sense at the time: regulation raises the compliance bar, which protects incumbents against fly-by-night issuers with no reserves and no audit trail.

But the GENIUS Act didn't just raise the bar for crypto. It lowered the bar for banks.

Before the bill, a bank launching a stablecoin faced regulatory ambiguity. The OCC issued interpretive letters saying national banks could custody crypto and facilitate stablecoin reserves, but there was no explicit stablecoin framework. Banks are conservative. Ambiguity means no.

After the bill, there's a clear charter. And banks already have everything Circle had to build from scratch: deposit insurance, regulatory relationships, balance sheet capacity, and — this is the part that matters — distribution. JPMorgan has 82 million consumer accounts and 6 million business accounts. That's the distribution Circle pays $908 million a year to rent from Coinbase.

I keep coming back to a question I can't resolve: did Circle spend four years lobbying for a regulatory framework that makes it easier for JPMorgan to eat their lunch?

### What I can't figure out

The timing bothers me.

Circle filed for IPO in January 2025, targeting a $5 billion valuation. The GENIUS Act advanced through committee two months later. If you're about to go public, you want regulatory clarity — but you don't necessarily want clarity that invites the largest bank in the country into your market.

Maybe Circle's bet is speed. Bank stablecoins won't get traction because banks are slow and that's probably true for 2025-2026. Kinexys processes $2 billion daily but only for institutional clients. Retail issuance would require new infrastructure, new compliance workflows, new products.

But by 2028? I genuinely don't know. The structural advantage of a bank stablecoin — deposit insurance covering the stablecoin itself, existing customer base of tens of millions, no Coinbase taking 54% — is hard to compete against. And the GENIUS Act just removed the one barrier that was stopping them.

### Two things to watch

Tether's quarterly attestation reports. If they establish a US banking relationship, the offshore arbitrage thesis weakens. If they don't — and volume keeps growing anyway — the offshore model works and the GENIUS Act is enforcement theater for the largest stablecoin on earth.

Bank stablecoin announcements from JPMorgan, Citi, or BofA. Not the institutional-only pilots they've been running. Consumer-facing issuance.

At least one top-5 US bank issues a retail stablecoin by Q2 2027. And when it happens, Circle's IPO valuation will look expensive in hindsight.
