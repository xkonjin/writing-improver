# Who Gets Rich From Stablecoin Regulation

The GENIUS Act passed the Senate Banking Committee in March 2025 with an 18-6 vote. Five Democrats crossed over. I've been reading the actual bill text, and the thing that jumped out wasn't the reserve requirements or the state-vs-federal licensing structure. It was section 4(a)(2): issuers with more than $10 billion in outstanding stablecoins must obtain a federal charter.

That's Tether and Circle. Nobody else is close.

I spent the week mapping out who actually benefits from this — and the answer isn't who you'd expect from the headline coverage.

### The $10 billion line

The $10 billion threshold creates a two-tier market. Below it, state-chartered issuers operate under existing state money transmitter frameworks. Above it, you need a federal charter from the OCC, full bank-level supervision, and reserves held in insured depository institutions or short-duration Treasuries.

Circle already has this infrastructure. BNY Mellon custodies their reserves. BlackRock manages the Circle Reserve Fund. They're spending $908 million a year on Coinbase distribution. The compliance cost is already baked in.

Tether doesn't. $192 billion in reserves, mostly T-bills, but custodied through Cantor Fitzgerald and a network of non-US counterparties. No US banking relationship. No federal charter. And here's the part I didn't expect: Tether probably doesn't need one.

### The offshore exemption that nobody's talking about

Section 5 of the GENIUS Act covers "foreign stablecoin issuers." The requirements are lighter: register with FinCEN, maintain comparable reserves, submit to annual audits. But the enforcement mechanism is on US exchanges, not on Tether itself. US platforms that list non-compliant foreign stablecoins face penalties.

So Tether's actual regulatory question isn't "can we get a federal charter?" It's "will Coinbase and Kraken keep listing USDT?"

Coinbase already delisted USDT in Europe after MiCA. They could do it again. But Tether's volume runs through Binance (38% of global spot volume) and Tron-based OTC desks. Only 11% of USDT volume touches US-regulated exchanges. The bill's enforcement mechanism has a structural gap.

I was wrong about this being an existential threat to Tether. It's a mild inconvenience.

### Where the money actually moves

The interesting second-order effect isn't about Tether or Circle. It's about the custodians.

BNY Mellon manages $46.7 trillion in assets under custody. They started custodying crypto in 2022 with Bitcoin and Ether. Now they're positioning for stablecoin reserves. The GENIUS Act requires reserves in "insured depository institutions" — which means traditional banks get a guaranteed role in the stablecoin stack.

State Street, Northern Trust, and JPMorgan Chase's custody arm are all building stablecoin reserve custody capabilities. And the fee structure is remarkable: custodying $50 billion in T-bills for Circle generates roughly $15-25 million annually in custody fees. Low margin, but it's risk-free revenue attached to a market growing 40% year over year.

Then there's the banking angle. The bill creates a new "payment stablecoin issuer" charter. Banks can issue stablecoins directly. JPMorgan already runs JPM Coin (now Kinexys). Citi, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America all have blockchain payment pilots. The GENIUS Act gives them a legal framework to issue dollar stablecoins that compete directly with USDC.

Which is probably why Circle pushed so hard for this bill. And probably why it might backfire on them.

### The bank stablecoin problem

Circle lobbied for stablecoin regulation since 2021. The logic made sense: regulation raises the compliance bar, which protects incumbents against fly-by-night issuers. But the GENIUS Act didn't just raise the bar for crypto. It lowered the bar for banks.

Before the bill, a bank launching a stablecoin faced regulatory ambiguity. The OCC issued interpretive letters saying national banks could custody crypto and facilitate stablecoin reserves, but there was no explicit stablecoin framework. Banks are conservative. Ambiguity means no.

After the bill, there's a clear charter. And banks already have the infrastructure: deposit insurance, regulatory relationships, balance sheet capacity, and — crucially — distribution. JPMorgan has 82 million consumer accounts. That's distribution Circle pays $908 million a year to rent from Coinbase.

I keep coming back to a question: did Circle spend four years lobbying for a regulatory framework that makes it easier for JPMorgan to eat their lunch?

### What I can't figure out

The timing is strange. Circle filed for IPO in January 2025, targeting a $5 billion valuation. The GENIUS Act advanced through committee two months later. If you're about to go public, you want regulatory clarity — but you don't want regulatory clarity that invites JPMorgan into your market.

Maybe Circle's bet is that bank stablecoins won't get traction because banks are slow. And that's probably true for 2025-2026. JPMorgan's Kinexys processes $2 billion per day but only for institutional clients. Retail stablecoin issuance would require new infrastructure, new compliance workflows, new customer-facing products.

But by 2028? I genuinely don't know. The structural advantage of a bank stablecoin — deposit insurance, existing customer base, no Coinbase revenue share — is significant. And the GENIUS Act just removed the regulatory barrier.

### Two things to watch

Tether's quarterly attestation reports. If Tether establishes a US banking relationship or applies for a federal charter, the thesis that they can ignore US regulation through offshore arbitrage gets weaker. If they don't — and volume keeps growing anyway — the offshore model works.

Bank stablecoin announcements. JPMorgan, Citi, and Bank of America in particular. If any of them launch a consumer-facing stablecoin within 18 months of the GENIUS Act passing, Circle's competitive moat just got a lot shallower.

The prediction I'd make: at least one top-5 US bank issues a retail stablecoin by Q2 2027. And Circle's IPO valuation will look expensive in hindsight.
