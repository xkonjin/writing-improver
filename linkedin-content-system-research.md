## 1. LinkedIn Algorithm & Viral Mechanics (2025-2026)

### How the Algorithm Currently Works

LinkedIn's algorithm is **deliberately designed to prevent content from going viral**. It fills feeds with the most relevant professional advice and expertise rather than broadcasting to all followers. Distribution is precision delivery to people most likely to care.

**Three-Stage Distribution Process:**

| Stage                                   | What Happens                                                                                                         | Timeline                            |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Stage 1: Quality Filtering**          | Post shown to 2-5% of your network. Algorithm checks for spam, engagement bait, policy violations.                   | Immediate                           |
| **Stage 2: Initial Engagement Testing** | LinkedIn monitors how your closest connections respond. Evaluates _how_ they engage, not just _whether_.             | First 60-90 minutes ("Golden Hour") |
| **Stage 3: Extended Distribution**      | Strong early engagement pushes to wider audience: 2nd-degree connections, users with similar professional interests. | 48-72 hours if engagement sustains  |

**What the Algorithm Prioritizes (ranked):**

1. **Meaningful engagement** -- Comment quality influences distribution more than likes or vanity metrics
2. **Expert content** -- Frameworks, industry breakdowns, valuable insights get visibility boosts
3. **Dwell time** -- Posts that keep users reading longer see better distribution
4. **Relationship depth** -- Content from meaningful connections shown more than viral posts from strangers
5. **Topical relevance** -- Content matched to reader's professional interests and behaviors

**What the Algorithm Penalizes:**

- Engagement bait ("Comment YES if you agree!")
- Clickbait and vague storytelling
- Overly promotional posts
- External links (sends people off-platform)
- Coordinated engagement pods (detected via pattern recognition)

**Platform-Wide Trends (2025-2026):**

- Views down ~50% across the platform
- Engagement down ~25%
- Follower growth down ~59%
- This reflects LinkedIn's shift toward quality over viral reach -- the algorithm is deliberately tightening distribution

### Content Format Reach Rankings (2025-2026)

Based on data from Socialinsider's benchmark study of 1M+ posts and other sources:

| Format                       | Avg. Engagement Rate | Reach Multiplier (2026) | Notes                                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-image posts**        | 6.60%                | High                    | Most engaging format overall                   |
| **Document carousels (PDF)** | 5.85-6.10%           | High                    | Up to 3x more engagement than single images    |
| **Native video**             | 5.60%                | +69% boost              | 5x more engagement than external video links   |
| **Polls**                    | High impressions     | 1.19x (down from 1.64x) | Dropped 35% in 2026; declining reliability     |
| **Text-only posts**          | ~4% (improving)      | Moderate                | 51% of users most likely to interact with text |
| **Single-image posts**       | Low                  | -30% vs text in 2026    | Reversed from 2024-2025 patterns               |

**Key Format Insights:**

- **Carousels remain king** -- PDF document posts generate the most dwell time because users actively swipe through slides
- **Native video is surging** -- Videos under 60 seconds get highest engagement; add captions (85% watch without sound); upload directly, never share YouTube links
- **Polls are declining** -- Once dominant, now penalized; the algorithm caught on to the "frictionless engagement" gaming
- **Text posts are underrated** -- LinkedIn is one of the few platforms where text outperforms visuals; opinion-led and storytelling content driving the improvement
- **Single images now underperform text** -- A major 2026 algorithm reversal

### Dwell Time: The Most Critical Signal

Dwell time has **dethroned the Like** as the primary driver of organic reach in 2026. It measures actual seconds/minutes a user spends consuming your content.

**How It Works:**

- If a user spends **>15 seconds** on your post (reading a long caption or swiping a carousel), your **reach multiplier kicks in**
- The algorithm treats dwell time as a signal of "true depth and value"
- Longer dwell time = more distribution to wider audiences
- This is why carousels and long-form text outperform quick-consume formats

**Content That Maximizes Dwell Time:**

1. **PDF carousels** -- Users swipe through slides, increasing time on post
2. **Long-form text posts (1,300-1,600 characters)** -- Optimal reading time of 30-45 seconds matches the algorithm's sweet spot
3. **Native video** -- Autoplay captures attention; captions keep people watching
4. **Multi-step frameworks** -- Numbered lists that people read through completely
5. **Storytelling with tension** -- Narrative arc keeps readers engaged to the end

### Optimal Posting Times, Frequency, and Cadence

**Posting Frequency:**

| Frequency                  | Result                                                                    | Best For                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **2-3 posts/week**         | Algorithm rewards substance over volume                                   | Complex B2B, thought leadership  |
| **3-5 posts/week**         | +1,182 more impressions per post; +0.23% engagement rate lift vs. 1x/week | Active brand building            |
| **5-7 posts/week (daily)** | Maximum engagement for dedicated creators                                 | Full-time content creators       |
| **11+ posts/week**         | ~17,000 more impressions per post; 3x engagement                          | Company pages with content teams |

**The Rule:** One exceptional post per week that generates conversations is better than five mediocre daily publications that get ignored.

**Optimal Posting Times:**

- **Tuesday-Thursday, 8:00-11:00 AM** in your audience's local time zone -- consistently highest engagement
- **Tuesday & Wednesday: 8-11 AM** -- Peak engagement windows
- **Thursday: 10 AM-12 PM** -- Strong secondary window
- **Friday: 9-11 AM** -- Good for lighter/reflective content
- **Avoid:** Weekends and late evenings (unless targeting global audiences)

**Cadence Strategy:**

- Consistency matters more than timing -- posting at the same time each week outperforms random timing
- The "Golden Hour" (first 60 minutes) is critical -- reply to every comment in this window
- Space posts 24-48 hours apart to avoid cannibalizing your own reach

"We analyzed 847 failed payment startups. The #1 reason they died had nothing to do with product."
```

- Numbers signal structure
- Tells reader "this won't waste your time"
- Promises clarity and action

**3. Question Hook**

```
"What if everything you've been told about fintech compliance is actually making you less compliant?"
```

- Creates mental engagement

### Character Limits and Formatting Best Practices

**Character Limits:**

| Element             | Limit                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Post text           | 3,000 characters (~400-500 words)          |
| "See more" cutoff   | ~210 characters                            |
| Optimal post length | 1,300-1,600 characters (30-45 second read) |
| Hashtags            | 3-5 at end of post                         |
| Comment text        | 1,250 characters                           |

**Formatting Rules:**

1. **Short paragraphs** -- 1-2 sentences max per paragraph
2. **Line breaks** -- Use strategically between paragraphs for whitespace
3. **Visual markers** -- Use arrows (->), bullets, check marks to guide the eye
4. **No Unicode bold/italic** -- Hurts accessibility and searchability; LinkedIn doesn't support native bold
5. **Emojis sparingly** -- 1-3 relevant emojis can increase engagement by 25%
6. **End with CTA or question** -- Drives comments, which drive distribution
7. **Hashtags at end** -- 3-5 relevant ones; don't clutter the body

**The Ideal Text Post Structure:**

```
[Hook -- first 210 characters, stop the scroll]

[Line break]

[Context -- 2-3 sentences setting up the insight]

[Line break]

[Core insight -- the meat, formatted as list/framework/story]

[Line break]

[Takeaway -- 1-2 sentences crystallizing the lesson]

[Line break]

[CTA -- question or call-to-action to drive comments]

[Line break]

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

## 2. Slack-Shareable Content Framework

### What Makes Content Get Copy-Pasted into Slack

**The Core Insight:** Slack sharing is **utility-driven, not performative.** People share content in Slack because it solves problems or demonstrates genuine value to their team -- not to build their personal brand.

**Dark Social Reality:**

- Dark social accounts for an estimated **84% of online sharing**
- 77.5% of buyers share links through dark social channels (Slack, DMs, email)
- 100% of visits from Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp show as "direct traffic" in analytics -- completely invisible
- Enterprise fintech deals now involve **8.5 stakeholders** (up from 6.8) -- your content needs to travel through internal channels to reach all of them

**The 5 Triggers for Slack Sharing:**

1. **Problem-Solving Utility** -- "This solves something we're dealing with right now"
2. **Social Currency** -- "Sharing this makes me look knowledgeable to my team"
3. **Conversation Starter** -- "This will spark a good discussion in our #strategy channel"
4. **Reference Material** -- "We need to save this for the project we're working on"
5. **Novelty Signal** -- "Nobody else on the team has seen this yet"

### Social Currency: Content That Makes the Sharer Look Smart

**Jonah Berger's STEPPS Framework** (from _Contagious: Why Things Catch On_) provides the science:

| STEPPS Element      | Definition                                                          | B2B Fintech Application                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Social Currency** | People share things that make them look good, smart, or in-the-know | Exclusive research reports, insider data, contrarian analysis              |
| **Triggers**        | Content tied to recurring events or contexts                        | Earnings season analysis, regulatory deadline breakdowns                   |
| **Emotion**         | High-arousal emotions drive sharing                                 | Surprise (unexpected data), awe (massive scale), anxiety (compliance risk) |
| **Public**          | Built to show, built to grow                                        | Carousel designs that look professional when shared                        |
| **Practical Value** | Useful information people want to pass along                        | Checklists, frameworks, templates, calculators                             |
| **Stories**         | Information wrapped in narrative                                    | Customer stories, "here's what happened when..."                           |

**Social Currency in B2B Context:**

The key insight: In B2B, "looking good" means **reinforcing professional standing.** Sharing content in Slack that makes you look smart means:

- **"I'm at the industry forefront"** -- Sharing novel data, unique insights, or contrarian viewpoints
- **"I found the answer to our problem"** -- Articles addressing common business challenges
- **"I predicted this trend"** -- Content about emerging technologies or regulatory changes
- **"I have taste/judgment"** -- Curating high-quality content others haven't seen

**How to Engineer Social Currency:**

1. **Include original data** -- Even small surveys or analyses create an "insider" feeling
2. **Name-drop intelligently** -- Reference specific companies, tools, or people your audience respects
3. **Create "aha moments"** -- Reframe a common problem in a way nobody has before
4. **Use specific numbers** -- "73% cost reduction" is more shareable than "significant savings"
5. **Time it to events** -- Post regulatory analysis before deadlines, market analysis after earnings

### Content That Provides Immediate Tactical Value

**The "Slack Drop" Test:** Before publishing, ask: "Would someone copy-paste this into their team's Slack channel with the message 'we should read this'?"

**High-Value Content Types That Pass the Test:**

1. **Frameworks with immediate application**
   - "The 3-step compliance checklist for PSD3 readiness"
   - "How to evaluate embedded finance partners (scorecard included)"

2. **Data that changes decisions**
   - "Payment failure rates by industry: 2026 benchmarks"
   - "Average time-to-integration for top 10 payment APIs"

3. **Teardowns that teach**
   - "How Stripe's pricing page converts at 3x the industry average"
   - "Why Revolut's onboarding flow beats every neobank"

4. **Templates people can steal**
   - "The exact RFP template we use for payment processor selection"
   - "Our fintech investor update email template"

5. **Contrarian insights backed by evidence**
   - "Why we stopped chasing bank partnerships (and revenue went up)"
   - "The compliance audit process that regulators actually love"

---

### The Screenshot Test

**Definition:** Content formatted so well it gets screenshotted and shared as an image, bypassing the need to click any link.

**Why Screenshots Work:**

- No need to exit the platform
- No page load time
- Instant consumption on mobile
- Information density visible at a glance
- Easy to share across any channel (Slack, iMessage, email, WhatsApp)

**How to Pass the Screenshot Test:**

1. **One core idea per visual** -- Not a wall of text, but a single memorable insight
2. **Data nuggets** -- Original charts and stats that double as quick references
3. **Clean formatting** -- Use whitespace, alignment, and hierarchy
4. **Hot takes in context** -- Opinions that are provocative but defensible
5. **Self-contained** -- The screenshot alone delivers the value; no click needed

**Format Implications:**

- Carousel slides are naturally screenshot-friendly (each slide = one idea)
- Text posts with clean line breaks and formatting get screenshotted
- Infographic-style data visualizations spread fastest
- The simpler the format, the more shareable it becomes

## 3. Content Systems & Processes for LinkedIn

### Batch Content Creation Workflows

**The Proven Batch System:**

```
MONDAY: Idea Capture (30 min)
- Review saved articles, notes, conversations from the week
- Capture 5-10 content ideas in a running document
- Tag each idea with format type (text, carousel, video, etc.)

WEDNESDAY: Batch Creation Session (90 min)
- Draft 5-7 posts from your idea bank
- Write hooks first, then fill in body
- Use framework templates to speed creation
- Don't edit during creation -- just draft

THURSDAY: Edit & Polish (45 min)
- Refine drafts with fresh eyes
- Optimize hooks (test against the 210-character cutoff)
- Add formatting, hashtags, CTAs
- Schedule posts for the following week

DAILY: Engage (15-20 min)
- Reply to comments on your posts (especially in the Golden Hour)
- Leave 5-10 meaningful comments on others' posts
- Capture new content ideas from conversations
```

**Key Principle:** "Batch the structure, not the soul." Use frameworks to speed creation while leaving room for spontaneity, personality, and responsiveness.

**Automation Layer:**

Tools like n8n can automate portions of the workflow:

- Pull content ideas from RSS feeds, Perplexity research, or saved bookmarks
- Generate draft posts using AI (with your brand voice guidelines)
- Save drafts to Google Sheets for review
- Auto-schedule approved posts to LinkedIn

### Content Repurposing Systems (1 Piece -> Many)

**The Content Pyramid:**

```
                    [1 PILLAR PIECE]
                   (newsletter/blog/report)
                  /          |          \
         [3-5 LinkedIn    [1 Carousel]   [1 Video]
          Text Posts]      (8-12 slides)  (<60 sec)
         /    |    \           |              |
    [Comments] [Threads] [Screenshots]  [Short clips]
```

**The 1-to-15 System (Under 2 Hours):**

From one substantial blog post or newsletter issue, create:

| Asset                          | Time   | How                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1 LinkedIn long-form text post | 15 min | Extract the core thesis + 1 key insight        |
| 1 PDF carousel (8-10 slides)   | 30 min | Turn main points into slide-by-slide framework |
| 3 standalone insight posts     | 20 min | One post per major section/finding             |
| 1 contrarian take post         | 10 min | Flip the conventional wisdom from your piece   |
| 1 "here's what I learned" post | 10 min | Personal narrative wrapping the insights       |
| 1 data visualization post      | 15 min | Chart or stat from your research               |
| 3 comment-length insights      | 5 min  | Use as comments on related posts by others     |
| 2 question/poll posts          | 5 min  | Turn key findings into audience questions      |
| 1 newsletter intro             | 5 min  | Tease the full piece                           |
| 1 60-second video summary      | 15 min | Record key takeaways talking to camera         |

**Strategic Starting Point:** Lead with your newsletter as the pillar piece. The world's top creators write the newsletter first, then repurpose outward to all other platforms.

### Engagement Pod Strategies (What Works Now)

**The 2025-2026 Reality:** Traditional engagement pods are effectively dead. LinkedIn's AI now detects them through:

- Comment velocity patterns
- Account relationship analysis
- Engagement history tracking
- Semantic content analysis of comments
- Temporal engagement pattern recognition

Participation in detected pods leads to **account-wide distribution restrictions.**

**What Replaces Pods (Ethical Alternatives):**

1. **Genuine Creator Communities**
   - Join Slack/Discord groups of 10-20 creators in your niche
   - Share each other's best content _only when genuinely relevant_
   - No obligation to engage with every post -- only authentic resonance
   - The engagement is organic because it's driven by actual interest

2. **Strategic Comment Partnerships**
   - Find 5-10 creators whose audience overlaps with yours
   - Regularly comment with substantive, value-adding thoughts on their posts
   - This creates natural reciprocity without artificial coordination
   - The algorithm rewards this because the engagement is genuine

3. **Employee Amplification Programs**
   - Have team members share and comment on company content
   - Provide them with talking points but let them add personal perspective
   - Employee-Generated Content (EGC) is one of 2026's biggest trends
   - More authentic than pod engagement; algorithm rewards it

4. **Content Collaboration**
   - Co-create content with complementary creators
   - Tag each other in relevant posts
   - Cross-pollinate audiences through genuine collaboration

### Comment Strategy for Growth

**The Data:**

- Users who comment strategically **5-10 times/day** see a **55% increase in profile views** and **20% more reach** on their own content
- Messages sent after a meaningful comment exchange had a **52% reply rate** vs. 18% for cold outreach
- Replying to comments on your own posts boosts engagement by **~30%** (analysis of 72,000 posts)
- Meaningful comments (10+ words) receive significantly more algorithmic weight

**The 3-Part Comment Formula:**

```
1. VALIDATE -- Acknowledge the poster's point
   "This is exactly right about payment failure rates..."

2. ADD VALUE -- Share your own experience or data
   "We saw something similar -- when we switched to adaptive retry logic, our success rate jumped 12%."

3. OPEN A DOOR -- Ask a question or invite further discussion
   "Have you tried implementing this with real-time currency conversion? Curious how that changes the math."
```

**Optimal Comment Strategy:**

- **Mix:** 1 post per week + 5-10 meaningful comments per day
- **Timing:** Engage with posts within the first 10-15 minutes of publication (early comments get most visibility)
- **Length:** 10+ words minimum; avoid "Great post!" or emoji-only responses
- **Targeting:** Comment on posts from people whose audience you want to reach
- **Reciprocity:** Always reply to comments on your own posts, especially in the Golden Hour

### How Top Creators Systematize Their Posting

**The Three C's System:**

1. **Capture** -- Continuously collect ideas (phone notes, saved articles, conversation highlights). This is the most important habit for new creators.
2. **Curate** -- Share and comment on others' content with your perspective added. Mix curated content with original posts.
3. **Create** -- Batch creation sessions using frameworks and templates. Be realistic about weekly capacity.

**The Editorial Workflow That Doubles Followings:**

Design an environment where showing up is the path of least resistance:

- Capturing an idea takes seconds (quick-capture tool on phone)
- Creating feels focused instead of panicked (templates + batch sessions)
- Hitting publish is just the natural next step (pre-scheduled queue)

**Key Creator Tools:**

| Tool           | Purpose                                                     | Pricing          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **AuthoredUp** | All-in-one LinkedIn content creation, formatting, analytics | Paid             |
| **Taplio**     | AI-powered LinkedIn writing, scheduling, analytics          | Paid             |
| **Shield**     | LinkedIn analytics and performance tracking                 | Paid             |
| **Postiz**     | Open-source scheduling across platforms                     | Free/self-hosted |
| **n8n**        | Workflow automation for content pipelines                   | Free/self-hosted |

**The Minimum Viable System:**

```
Weekly commitment: ~4 hours total

- 30 min/week: Idea capture and review
- 90 min/week: Batch creation (3-5 posts)
- 45 min/week: Editing and scheduling
- 15 min/day (75 min/week): Commenting and engagement
```

## 4. LinkedIn Content Formats That Work for Fintech

### Format 1: Teardown Posts (Analyzing a Company's Growth)

**Why They Work:**

- High dwell time (readers study every detail)
- Social currency (makes sharer look analytically sophisticated)
- Gets shared in #strategy and #competitive-intel Slack channels
- Creates discussion and debate in comments

**Template:**

```
[HOOK]: "How [Company] grew from [X] to [Y] in [timeframe]. A thread."

[CONTEXT]: Brief company background. What makes this growth remarkable.

[THE BREAKDOWN]:
- Key metric 1: What they did + the result
- Key metric 2: What they did + the result
- Key metric 3: What they did + the result

[THE INSIGHT]: What most people miss about their strategy.

[THE LESSON]: What you can steal from this for your own business.

[CTA]: "What's the most impressive fintech growth story you've seen?"
```

**Fintech Examples:**

- "Stripe processed $1.4T in 2024 with 38% YoY growth. Here's what most people miss about their strategy."
- "Plaid added 500M bank accounts in 6 years, growing 90% annually. The secret? They indexed on consumer fintech growth."
- "Ramp went from 0 to $100M ARR faster than any fintech in history. Here's the playbook."

---

### Format 2: "Here's What I Learned" Framework Posts

**Why They Work:**

- Personal and authentic -- the "learning in public" approach
- Positions you as honest and transparent
- Creates instant credibility through vulnerability
- Readers feel they're getting insider knowledge

**Template:**

```
[HOOK]: "After [X years/months] in [area], here's what nobody tells you about [topic]:"

[LIST FORMAT]:
1. [Lesson] -- [Brief explanation + specific example]
2. [Lesson] -- [Brief explanation + specific example]
3. [Lesson] -- [Brief explanation + specific example]
...

[VULNERABLE MOMENT]: "The biggest mistake I made was [X]. Here's how I'd do it differently."

[TAKEAWAY]: One sentence crystallizing the overall lesson.

[CTA]: "What's the biggest lesson you've learned in [area]?"
```

**Fintech Examples:**

- "After 8 years building payment infrastructure, here are 7 things I'd tell my younger self"
- "I've reviewed 200+ fintech pitch decks. Here's what separates the funded from the forgotten."
- "3 years ago I thought compliance was a cost center. Here's what changed my mind."

---

### Format 3: Contrarian Takes on Industry Trends

**Why They Work:**

- Disrupts the echo chamber
- Sparks intense debate, which the algorithm rewards with massive reach
- Comments from people who strongly agree _or_ disagree both signal high engagement
- Creates social currency ("I saw this hot take, what do you think?")

**The Rules:**

- Must be insightful, not just controversial for controversy's sake
- Must be supported by logic, data, or personal experience
- Must be defensible -- you should be able to argue your position in comments
- Best when challenging a "sacred cow" of the industry

**Template:**

```
[HOOK]: "Unpopular opinion: [Contrarian statement about fintech]"

[THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM]: "Everyone says [X]. The conferences echo it. The VCs repeat it."

[THE COUNTER-ARGUMENT]: "But here's what the data actually shows..."
- Evidence point 1
- Evidence point 2
- Evidence point 3

[THE NUANCE]: "I'm not saying [X] is always wrong. I'm saying [specific condition where the conventional wisdom breaks down]."

[CTA]: "Am I wrong? Tell me what I'm missing."
```

**Fintech Examples:**

- "Unpopular opinion: Most embedded finance strategies will fail. Here's why."
- "Everyone says real-time payments are the future. The data says otherwise for most B2B use cases."
- "Hot take: The best fintech companies of 2030 won't call themselves fintech."
- "We stopped chasing bank partnerships. Revenue went up. Here's the counterintuitive reason."

---

### Format 4: Data-Driven Insight Posts

**Why They Work:**

- Original data is the ultimate social currency
- Even small analyses create an "insider" feeling
- Gets referenced and saved as benchmark material
- Carousel format + data = maximum dwell time + screenshots

**Performance Data:**

- Research-based content generates **4x more leads** than promotional content
- Breaking research into multiple posts creates an extended engagement cycle
- 59% of B2B buyers consume creator content on LinkedIn -- more than any other platform

**Template:**

```
[HOOK]: "We analyzed [X data points/companies/transactions]. Here's what we found."

[THE SETUP]: Why this data matters. What question you were trying to answer.

[KEY FINDING 1]: [Stat] + [Implication]
[KEY FINDING 2]: [Stat] + [Implication]
[KEY FINDING 3]: [Stat] + [Implication]

[THE SURPRISE]: "The most unexpected finding was..."

[WHAT THIS MEANS]: Practical implications for your audience.

[CTA]: "Want the full dataset? Drop a comment and I'll send it."
```

**Fintech Examples:**

- "We analyzed 847 fintech seed rounds from 2024-2025. The average pre-money valuation dropped 34%, but there's a twist..."
- "Payment failure rates by country: We processed 100M transactions and here's what surprised us"
- "Our data shows embedded lending converts 4.7x better when offered at point-of-sale. Here are the numbers."

### Format 5: Thread/Carousel Breakdowns of Complex Topics

**Why They Work for Fintech:**

- Fintech topics are inherently complex (regulations, infrastructure, APIs)
- Carousels break complexity into digestible slides
- Each swipe increases dwell time
- Slides are individually screenshot-friendly
- Professional design signals credibility

**Carousel Best Practices:**

| Element        | Recommendation                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Slide count    | 8-12 slides (sweet spot for engagement)          |
| Format         | 1080x1080 px (square) or 1080x1350 px (vertical) |
| File type      | PDF preferred (maintains design integrity)       |
| Text per slide | 1 idea per slide; short, scannable text          |
| Design         | Clean, branded, consistent visual language       |
| CTA slide      | Always end with a call-to-action slide           |

**Carousel Topic Ideas for Fintech:**

1. "PSD3 Explained in 10 Slides"
2. "The Anatomy of a Payment Transaction (Visualized)"
3. "Open Banking vs. Open Finance: What's Actually Different"
4. "How to Choose a Payment Processor: Decision Framework"
5. "The History of Money in 10 Slides (And Where It's Going)"
6. "Embedded Finance Stack: Every Layer Explained"
7. "Fraud Prevention Checklist for Fintech Startups"

### Format 6: "Learning in Public" Style Posts

**Why They Work:**

- Authenticity is the common thread of all high-performing B2B content
- Builds trust by showing process, not just results
- Readers feel like they're on the journey with you
- Creates loyal followers who return for updates

**Template:**

```
[HOOK]: "Month [X] of building [product/company]. Here's what's actually happening."

[THE RAW TRUTH]:
- What went well this period
- What didn't go well (be specific)
- A metric or number that shows real progress

[THE LESSON]: What you learned that surprised you.

[THE NEXT STEP]: What you're trying next and why.

[CTA]: "Has anyone else experienced [specific challenge]? How did you handle it?"
```

**Fintech Examples:**

- "We're 6 months into building our payment API. We have 12 customers and we're burning $180K/month. Here's what I'm learning."
- "I spent 3 months trying to get a banking license. Here's my weekly diary of what actually happens."
- "Our fraud detection model had a 23% false positive rate. Here's how we're fixing it, step by step."
