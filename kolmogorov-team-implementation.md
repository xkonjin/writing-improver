# Team Implementation Guide: Kolmogorov Clarity

## Week 1: Awareness

**Monday:** Share the problem

- Send your original message about AI slop
- Share one egregious example from actual team docs

**Wednesday:** Introduce the solution

- Share kolmogorov-clarity-process.md
- Challenge: Everyone finds their worst verbose email from last week

**Friday:** First practice

- Everyone rewrites their worst email using the process
- Share before/after in team channel

## Week 2: Practice

**Daily Challenge:**

- Monday: Rewrite all emails using BLUF template
- Tuesday: Apply "So What?" test to every Slack message
- Wednesday: Compress all meeting notes to 5 lines max
- Thursday: Delete 50% of words from any document
- Friday: Write everything first as bullet points, then prose

**End of Week:** Share wins and failures

## Week 3: Integration

**Tools Setup:**

- Install LLM prompts as team shortcuts
- Create email templates
- Add clarity check to PR reviews
- Set up Slack bot that scores message clarity

**Metrics:**

- Average email length (target: -50%)
- Time to decision in meetings (target: -30%)
- Document revision cycles (target: -40%)

## Enforcement Rules

### The Hard Line

1. **No document over 2 pages** without executive approval
2. **No email over 5 lines** without attachment
3. **No meeting without BLUF agenda**
4. **No PR description over 1 paragraph**

### The Rewards

- **Clarity Champion:** Weekly award for best compression
- **Slop Detector:** Badge for catching verbose content
- **One-Liner Master:** Recognition for perfect BLUF examples

## Templates

### Standup Format

```
DONE: [One thing that matters]
DOING: [One thing today]
BLOCKED: [Yes + what / No]
```

### PR Description

```
CHANGES: [What changed in 10 words]
WHY: [Problem it solves in 10 words]
TEST: [How to verify in 10 words]
```

### Slack Message

```
@channel NEED: [Decision/action] BY: [Time]
Context: [One line if critical]
```

### Design Doc

```
PROBLEM: [One sentence]
SOLUTION: [One paragraph]
ALTERNATIVES: [Bullet list]
DECISION: [One sentence]
NEXT: [Numbered steps]
```

## Anti-Patterns to Kill

### The Hedge Monster

❌ "I think perhaps we might want to consider maybe..."
✅ "We should..."

### The Throat Clearer

❌ "As you may be aware, in our last discussion..."
✅ [Delete entirely, start with the point]

### The False Diplomat

❌ "While I appreciate your perspective and understand where you're coming from..."
✅ "I disagree because..."

### The Overexplainer

❌ "Let me provide some context about why this matters. As you know, our system..."
✅ "This breaks at 10K users."

### The Nervous Wrapper

❌ "I hope this makes sense, but please let me know if you need clarification..."
✅ [Delete entirely]

## Measurement

### Week 1 Baseline

Count in your last 10 emails:

- Total words
- Hedge words (perhaps, maybe, seems)
- Throat-clearing sentences
- Time to get to the point

### Week 4 Comparison

Same count. Target:

- 50% fewer total words
- Zero hedge words
- Zero throat-clearing
- Point in first sentence

## Escalation

### Level 1: Gentle Reminder

"Can you compress this using Kolmogorov Clarity?"

### Level 2: Public Scoring

Post Kolmogorov Ratio in thread (words used / minimum needed)

### Level 3: Rewrite It For Them

Show the compressed version publicly

### Level 4: The Wall of Slop

## Success Metrics

You've succeeded when:

- Meetings end early
- Decisions happen in one exchange
- No one asks "what do you mean?"
- Documents get read completely
- Email threads die quickly

## The Nuclear Option

If slop persists after 30 days:

**The Character Limit Rule:**

- Slack: 280 characters max
- Email: 500 characters max
- Docs: 1000 words max

Exceptions require VP approval with written justification of why more words are needed.

## FAQ

**Q: What if nuance is lost?**
A: Real nuance survives compression. Fake nuance doesn't.

**Q: What about relationship building?**
A: Build relationships in person. Documents are for decisions.

**Q: Doesn't this feel cold?**
A: Clarity is respect. Wasting time is cold.

**Q: What about complex topics?**
A: Complex topics need clarity most. Start simple, add only essential complexity.

## Final Word

**Verbose teams talk. Clear teams ship.**

Make clarity your competitive advantage.
