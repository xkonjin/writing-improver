## 1. PUBLISHING ORDER & TIMING

| Step | Platform           | Timing                    | Reason                                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Substack**       | Day 0, Tue/Fri 4-6 PM     | SEO canonical; Google indexes first; 50% open rate at 8 PM             |
| 2    | **Substack Notes** | Day 0                     | Cross-post key quote + link; drives 70% of new subscribers             |
| 3    | **X thread**       | Day 2-3, Wed/Thu 9-11 AM  | First 30 min = everything; engagement velocity determines distribution |
| 4    | **LinkedIn**       | Day 3-4, Wed/Thu 10-11 AM | Dwell time king; 24-48 hr content lifespan vs X's 15-30 min            |

**Why this order:** Substack first for SEO credit (LinkedIn domain authority can cannibalize). 2-3 day spacing avoids duplicate content penalties. X for discussion/virality. LinkedIn for professional reach and paid conversions.

## 2. PLATFORM ALGORITHM MECHANICS

### X/Twitter (Grok-Powered, Jan 2026)

| Signal                           | Weight | vs Like  |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Reply that gets author reply     | +75    | **150x** |
| Reply (general)                  | +13.5  | 27x      |
| Profile click after viewing      | +12.0  | 24x      |
| Click into conversation + engage | +11    | 22x      |
| Dwell time (2+ min)              | +10    | 20x      |
| Bookmark                         | +10    | **20x**  |
| Retweet                          | +1.0   | 2x       |
| Like                             | +0.5   | 1x       |

**Critical facts:**

- First 30 minutes determine algorithmic distribution
- Links INVISIBLE for non-Premium (zero median engagement since March 2026)
- Premium = 10x reach efficiency (near-mandatory)
- Grok reads every post — positive/constructive content boosted, negative throttled
- TweepCred score <17 = throttled impressions; >17 = normal; high = up to 50x amplification

### LinkedIn

| Signal                           | Impact                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Dwell time 61+ sec               | 15.6% engagement rate vs 1.2% at <3 sec   |
| Expert comment (industry figure) | **5-7x** weight vs random connection      |
| Discussion thread (multi-reply)  | **5.2x** amplification vs single comment  |
| PDF carousel                     | **6.60%** avg engagement (highest format) |
| First 60-90 min engagement       | Determines total reach                    |
| External links                   | 25-60% reach reduction                    |

**Critical facts:**

- Engagement bait now penalized (2026 update)
- Video crashed 35% in 2025, now 3.5% engagement
- Tagged expert response within 4 hours = 1.8x impact multiplier
- Weekend posting = wasted content (<5% engagement)

### Substack

| Signal                                    | Impact                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Internal traffic (Notes, Recommendations) | **4x** higher conversion than external  |
| Notes cross-posting 2-4x                  | "Huge impact" on subscriber growth      |
| Restacking with commentary                | Primary discovery driver                |
| Audience overlap with popular accounts    | Content surfaces to their readers       |
| 32M new subscribers from within app       | Internal ecosystem > external promotion |

**Critical facts:**

- Algorithm amplifies Notes, not newsletters
- 70% of one creator's subscribers from 20 min/day on Notes
- Substack Network drives 25% of paid subscriptions platform-wide
- Readers with email + credit card already in system = 3x more likely to pay

### 70/30 Planned vs Reactive Split

**70% planned:** Thesis cards on scheduled topics, recurring formats, pre-planned regulatory analysis (FOMC dates, earnings, GENIUS Act milestones).

**30% reactive:** Breaking news response within 24 hours. Pre-reserved calendar slots. System: monitor feeds → classify urgency → draft reactive take → publish same day.

### Known Calendar Events to Pre-Plan

- FOMC meetings (8/year, dates published in advance)
- Bank earnings season (quarterly)
- GENIUS Act implementation milestones (July 2026 final regulations)
- Token unlock schedules (publicly available)
- Major conferences: Consensus, Token2049, Permissionless

## 6. TAGGING STRATEGY

### X/Twitter

| Rule                 | Spec                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main post            | Zero @mentions                                                  |
| First reply          | Tag 1-3 directly relevant accounts                              |
| Who to tag           | Person you're citing, responding to, or whose data you're using |
| Never tag            | Random influencers hoping for engagement                        |
| Over-tagging penalty | Reports → reach suppression                                     |

### LinkedIn

| Rule                       | Spec                                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Per post                   | 1-2 people maximum                                        |
| Ask permission             | Before tagging (LinkedIn etiquette)                       |
| Who to tag                 | Collaborators, cited experts, people who contributed data |
| Expert response multiplier | 7-9x algorithmic weight if tagged expert responds         |
| Companies                  | 1-2 max, only if directly relevant                        |

### Hashtag Strategy

| Platform | Count | Placement             | Impact                                                |
| -------- | ----- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| X        | 1-2   | Mid-tweet, integrated | 21% boost; 3+ = 40% penalty                           |
| LinkedIn | 3-5   | End of post           | Declining impact (semantic search > hashtags in 2026) |
| Substack | 0     | N/A                   | Not a factor                                          |

### Finance/Crypto Hashtag Tiers

**Tier 1 (Broad):** #Cryptocurrency #FinTech #DeFi #Stablecoins
**Tier 2 (Targeted):** #CryptoRegulation #DigitalAssets #Payments #Web3
**Tier 3 (Niche):** #StablecoinRegulation #TradFi #InstitutionalCrypto

Mix: 1 broad + 1-2 niche per post.

## 7. MONITORING & REACTIVE CONTENT SYSTEM

### Tier 1: Real-Time Feeds

| Source                   | What It Catches                        | Action                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| @WatcherGuru (X)         | Breaking crypto news within minutes    | Evaluate for reactive thesis |
| @whale_alert (X)         | Large transactions (100+ BTC, 1K+ ETH) | Spot institutional moves     |
| CryptoQuant alerts       | Exchange flows, stablecoin flows       | Market structure shifts      |
| Federal Reserve calendar | FOMC meetings, minutes releases        | Pre-planned analysis         |

### Tier 2: Daily Monitoring

| Source                                                     | What It Catches            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| X Lists (custom: stablecoins, AI/crypto, regulation, DeFi) | Domain-specific signals    |
| Nansen smart money alerts                                  | Institutional wallet moves |
| DeFiLlama TVL dashboard                                    | Protocol-level shifts      |
| Google Alerts (your name + key terms)                      | Citations, mentions        |

### Tier 3: Weekly Deep Research

| Source                                  | Purpose                           |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| On-chain analytics (Glassnode, Dune)    | Long-term trend analysis          |
| Regulatory filings (SEC, OCC, Treasury) | Policy shifts                     |
| Earnings reports (Coinbase, Circle)     | Industry financial health         |
| Substack Notes trending                 | What the audience cares about now |

### Reactive Content Decision Tree

```
Breaking news → Is it in our thesis territory?
  → YES: Draft reactive take (< 4 hours)
    → Publish as X thread first (speed matters)
    → Expand to Substack if thesis-worthy
  → NO: Monitor but don't publish
    → Save data point for future thesis reference

## 8. GROWTH STRATEGY

### X (0 → 10K)

| Phase      | Tactics                                                                        | Rate         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **0-1K**   | Post 3-5x/day, Premium required, reply to major accounts, build TweepCred      | 50-100/week  |
| **1K-5K**  | Thread strategy (7-12 tweets), bookmark-optimized content, conversation depth  | 100-200/week |
| **5K-10K** | Native video (10x engagement), strategic tagging, cross-platform amplification | 200-300/week |

**Non-negotiables:** Premium subscription. Professional bio. Balanced follower/following ratio. Respond to every reply in first 30 min.

### LinkedIn (0 → 10K)

| Phase  | Duration | Focus                                                                      | Rate       |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 0-500  | 1-2 mo   | Profile optimization, 3-5 posts/week, strategic commenting (5-10/day)      | 20-30/wk   |
| 500-2K | 3-4 mo   | Content pillars (3-4 themes), carousel production (2-3/week), micro-series | 40-60/wk   |
| 2K-5K  | 5-7 mo   | Expert collaboration, niche depth, LinkedIn Newsletter launch              | 60-100/wk  |
| 5K-10K | 8-12 mo  | Flagship content, speaking/podcast appearances, media engagement           | 100-150/wk |

### Substack

| Lever                        | Impact                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Notes (20 min/day)           | 70% of new subscribers              |
| Recommendation swaps         | 1,000+ new subscribers per swap     |
| Internal Substack Network    | 25% of paid subscriptions           |
| LinkedIn → Substack pipeline | Highest-converting external traffic |
| Referral program             | Tier rewards at 1, 3, 5+ referrals  |

### Cross-Platform Flywheel

```
Substack thesis → X thread (drives discussion) → LinkedIn carousel (drives professional reach)
                                                                    ↓
X discussion generates new data/angles → feeds next thesis ← LinkedIn expert comments add depth
                                                                    ↓
Substack Notes cross-post → drives internal discovery → new subscribers
```

## 9. MONETIZATION PATH

### Pricing Benchmarks

| Tier         | Range       | Examples                                 |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Monthly      | $5-$20      | Stratechery $12/mo, The Diff $20/mo      |
| Annual       | $50-$220    | Stratechery $120/yr, The Diff $220/yr    |
| Founding/Pro | $300-$1,200 | Doomberg $300/yr standard, $1,200/yr Pro |

### Conversion Funnel

| Stage                                      | Rate                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Free subscriber → Paid                     | 2-6% typical; 10% Doomberg target                  |
| Internal Substack traffic → Paid           | **4x** higher than external                        |
| Substack Network subscriber → Paid new pub | **3x** more likely (credit card already in system) |

### When to Go Paid

**Doomberg model:** Wait until free growth slows to define addressable market. Expected 10% conversion. Price at median of top 40 finance newsletters, not at Substack's default.

### Revenue Model (Thesis Cards)

At 5,000 free subscribers, 5% conversion, $15/month:

- 250 paid × $15 × 12 = **$45,000/year**
- Substack takes 10% + Stripe ~3% = $5,850 in fees
- Net: ~$39,000/year

At 10,000 free, 5% conversion, $20/month:

- 500 paid × $20 × 12 = **$120,000/year**

**Beyond subscriptions:** Telegram group (premium tier), courses, consulting, speaking.

## 10. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### What's Oversaturated

- Bitcoin price predictions
- Generic "top coins" content
- Surface-level regulatory news recaps
- "Crypto adoption is coming" motivational takes

### Coverage Gaps (Your Territory)

| Gap                                                                     | Why It's Open                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Stablecoin revenue mechanics (where Circle/Tether money comes from)     | Most cover price, not business model         |
| B2B stablecoin infrastructure (cross-border, treasury, payroll)         | "Boring plumbing" nobody covers              |
| AI/crypto intersection beyond hype (unit economics, who captures value) | Most are either AI-only or crypto-only       |
| Regulatory strategy analysis (incentive structures, not just news)      | Requires both finance + policy expertise     |
| Value capture framework application (Aggregation Theory → crypto)       | Academic frameworks rarely applied to crypto |
| Prediction accountability (monthly scorecards)                          | Almost nobody does this                      |

### Voice Models to Study

| Writer                     | What to Learn                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Matt Levine                | Cultural integration + humor + financial mechanics            |
| patio11 (Patrick McKenzie) | Systems thinking + financial infrastructure as sociotechnical |
| Byrne Hobart (The Diff)    | Daily inflection point analysis + operating models            |
| Austin Campbell            | Sharp regulatory takes + provocative positioning              |
| Nic Carter                 | Data-driven institutional perspective                         |

## 11. HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP AUTOMATION ARCHITECTURE

### What to Automate

| Task                         | Tool                                         | Human Role                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Research compilation         | Agents (Sonnet) + web search                 | Select relevant pieces, identify anomalies |
| On-chain data aggregation    | CryptoQuant/Glassnode APIs                   | Interpret structural meaning               |
| First draft of market briefs | Opus with DISORDER phase                     | Full rewrite for voice                     |
| Fact-checking                | Data verification system                     | Final judgment call                        |
| Image generation             | ImageGenAgent (classify → prompt → generate) | Approve/regenerate                         |
| Quality gate scanning        | Pipeline CLI (structural + vocab + surprise) | Interpret results, override if needed      |
| Scheduling/distribution      | Buffer/native scheduling                     | Approve timing                             |
| Notes cross-posting          | Manual (20 min/day)                          | Engagement requires human                  |

### What Must Stay Human

- **Insight generation** — AI compiles, humans synthesize non-obvious connections
- **Voice and tone** — Final edit pass (DISORDER phase critical)
- **Angle selection** — Which topic, what makes it interesting
- **Cultural zeitgeist** — Connecting finance to broader moments
- **Reply engagement** — First 30 min on X, first 90 min on LinkedIn
- **Tagging decisions** — Who to tag, when to tag

### Full Pipeline (Per Thesis Card)

```
1. INSIGHT GENERATION (Opus)
   └─ Cross-reference anomalies in data → mechanism → prediction

2. DISORDER PHASE (Manual)
   └─ Break organized research → discovery sequence → messy outline

3. DRAFT (Opus, from messy outline)
   └─ Write as if discovering each point for first time

4. QUALITY GATES (CLI, automated)
   └─ Structural scan → Vocab scan → Surprise detection → Compression

5. HUMAN EDIT (Manual)
   └─ Voice pass, cultural integration, genuine uncertainty

6. IMAGE GENERATION (ImageGenAgent)
   └─ Classify → Prompt → Generate → Export multi-size

7. PUBLISH SUBSTACK (Manual)
   └─ Subject line A/B test → header image → internal links → publish

8. CROSS-POST NOTES (Manual, same day)
   └─ Key quote + link

9. X THREAD (Day 2-3)
   └─ Extract 4-8 tweet sequence → post native → link in reply

10. LINKEDIN (Day 3-4)
    └─ 150-char hook + carousel → CTA to Substack
```
