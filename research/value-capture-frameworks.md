# Strategic Frameworks for Understanding Where Value Accrues in Technology Ecosystems

## A Complete Toolkit for Predicting Value Capture vs. Commoditization

---

## 1. Ben Thompson's Aggregation Theory

### Core Mechanism

The value chain in any consumer market has three parts: **suppliers**, **distributors**, and **consumers/users**. The internet collapsed distribution costs to zero, which shifted power from distributors to **aggregators**.

The mechanism operates in a precise sequence:

1. **Zero distribution costs** make it possible to serve users at zero marginal cost
2. **Superior user experience** attracts the initial user base
3. **Users attract suppliers** who come to the platform on the aggregator's terms
4. **More suppliers improve the user experience**, attracting more users
5. **Winner-take-all dynamics** emerge because customer acquisition costs decrease as the platform grows

Three defining characteristics of true aggregators: (1) a direct relationship with users with no intermediary, (2) zero marginal costs for serving users, and (3) demand-driven multi-sided networks with decreasing acquisition costs.

### How to Apply It as a Test

1. **Does this company have a direct relationship with end users?** If it reaches users only through another platform, it is supply, not an aggregator.
2. **Are its marginal costs truly zero?** If serving one more user costs meaningful money, it cannot achieve winner-take-all.
3. **Do more users attract more suppliers, which attract more users?** If the flywheel does not spin, it is not aggregation.
4. **Can suppliers easily leave?** If suppliers have nowhere else to go for demand, the aggregator has power.

### Application to Stablecoins

The aggregator question is: **who owns the end-user relationship?** The stablecoin issuer (Tether, Circle) is supply. The wallet or fintech app that the user opens daily is the aggregator. If Coinbase or Cash App users do not care whether they hold USDC or USDT -- they just want "dollars in the app" -- then the stablecoin is commoditized supply.

## 2. Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers

Seven conditions creating potential for **persistent differential returns**. Power requires both a **benefit** AND a **barrier**.

### The Seven Powers with Authenticity Tests

**1. Scale Economies** — Does a 2x increase in volume produce meaningful per-unit cost reduction? Or have diminishing returns already set in?

**2. Network Effects** — If you removed 50% of users, would the product become meaningfully worse? The critical question is **intensity**: how much does each marginal user improve the experience?

**3. Counter-Positioning** — Would copying the challenger's approach cannibalize the incumbent's profits? True counter-positioning requires the incumbent **structurally cannot respond** without self-harm.

**4. Switching Costs** — What percentage of users would leave immediately if a functionally equivalent competitor offered a 20% price cut? Customers trapped by switching costs are "basically screwed -- they wish they could leave." This creates slow-burning vulnerability.

**5. Branding** — Would customers pay 20%+ more for this product over an identical commodity alternative? Most B2B "brand moat" claims are actually just awareness, not branding.

**6. Cornered Resource** — Is the resource truly exclusive? Could a competitor with $1B acquire equivalent access? Data is the most commonly over-claimed cornered resource.

**7. Process Power** — If you hired the top 10 people from this company, could you replicate the advantage? Nearly always fake. Helmer himself notes this is the rarest Power.

## 3. Clayton Christensen's Law of Conservation of Attractive Profits

**When modularity and commoditization cause attractive profits to disappear at one stage in the value chain, the opportunity to earn attractive profits with proprietary products will usually emerge at an adjacent stage.**

### The Cycle

1. Early markets require **integration** because performance is not good enough
2. As technology overshoots customer needs, **standardized interfaces** emerge
3. The market **dis-integrates** into specialized layers
4. Profit migrates to whoever controls the **new performance bottleneck**
5. That bottleneck eventually gets solved, and value migrates again

### Application Test

1. **What is "not good enough"?** Value accrues to whoever controls that bottleneck.
2. **What is "more than good enough"?** Those layers will be commoditized.
3. **Watch the interfaces**: When interfaces standardize, the integrated player is about to lose value.
4. **Track where profit is migrating**: If an industry's profit pool is shifting between layers, this law is operating.

## 4. Joel Spolsky's "Commoditize Your Complement"

Smart companies try to commoditize their products' complements. Demand for a product increases when complement prices fall.

### Canonical Examples

- **Google**: Chrome commoditizes browsers, Android commoditizes mobile OS, all to increase search volume
- **Stripe's Bridge acquisition**: Making stablecoins interchangeable commodity rails to increase demand for Stripe's merchant services
- **Meta open-sources Llama**: Commoditizes AI models so no competitor can use proprietary AI to challenge Meta's ad business

### Application Test

1. **Map the complement structure**: What products are used together?
2. **Who benefits from commoditization of each layer?** The player at the adjacent layer.
3. **Is anyone actively funding competition in this layer?** If a large company is giving away something valuable for free, ask what complement they are commoditizing.
4. **Can the layer being commoditized defend itself?** If no switching costs, no network effects, no cornered resource — commoditization is inevitable.

## 5. The Smiling Curve

Value-added plotted against value chain stages produces a U-shape:

- **Left end (high value)**: R&D, design, IP, innovation
- **Middle (low value)**: Manufacturing, assembly, basic infrastructure
- **Right end (high value)**: Branding, distribution, customer relationships

In the stablecoin stack:

- **Left end**: Protocol design, regulatory compliance, reserve management strategy
- **Middle**: Basic token issuance, settlement infrastructure, transaction processing
- **Right end**: Wallet UX, merchant integration, consumer brand trust, distribution

## 6. Fat Protocols vs. Fat Apps

The 2016 thesis that blockchain protocols would capture value (unlike HTTP/TCP which captured zero) is **partially wrong**. Evidence from 2025-2026 shows apps capturing increasing value. Users interact with apps, not blockchains.

## 7. The Meta-Framework: Where Does Value Accrue?

### Step-by-Step Application

1. **Map the Stack** — Every layer from raw input to end consumer
2. **Apply the Smiling Curve** — Which layers are commodity middle? Which are high-value ends?
3. **Apply Porter's Forces to Each Layer** — Competitors, differentiation, switching costs, substitutes, bargaining power
4. **Apply Christensen's Conservation Law** — What's not good enough? What's overshooting?
5. **Identify the Aggregator** — Who owns end-user demand?
6. **Check for Commoditize Your Complement** — Who's funding competition in adjacent layers?
7. **Test Each Claimed Moat with 7 Powers** — Benefit AND barrier, or the moat is fake
8. **Predict the Next Transition** — Value migration is cyclical. What's the NEXT bottleneck?

### The Single Most Important Question

**Who owns the relationship with the end user?**

The entity closest to the user, with the most frequent interaction and the highest trust, will ultimately commoditize every layer beneath it.

## Stablecoin Value Capture Hierarchy (Predicted)

1. **Fintech apps with massive user bases** (PayPal, Cash App, Grab) — own demand, treat stablecoins as interchangeable supply
2. **Merchant integration platforms** (Stripe, Shopify) — own merchant relationship, commoditize stablecoins
3. **Exchanges** (Coinbase, Binance) — transitional power that diminishes as stablecoins shift from trading to payments
4. **Stablecoin issuers** (Circle, Tether) — facing commoditization pressure, market share declining from 94% to 82%
5. **Self-custody wallets** (MetaMask) — niche crypto-native audience

### Key Data Points (2025-2026)

- PYUSD processed $41B in October 2025 alone across PayPal/Venmo's 400M users
- Shopify stablecoin checkout volume exceeded $28B in Q3 2025
- Annual stablecoin volume above $27T, total market cap passing $300B
- Grab signed MOU with StraitsX for stablecoin settlement across 8 Asian markets
- Coinbase positioning as "stablecoin-powered everything app"
- Stripe processing $1.4T+ in payment volume (2024), valued at ~$107B
