- > 60% of crypto users regularly convert pesos to stablecoins
- 2.4% daily active crypto users (vs 0.4% regional average)

**Nigeria:**

- 26M stablecoin users (out of 213M population = 12.2% penetration)
- 22M total crypto holders (10.3%), so ~59% of crypto users hold stablecoins
- 47% of crypto users use stablecoins to save (Visa survey)

**Turkey:**

- 33% of 24-26M crypto investors hold stablecoins = 7.9-8.6M people
- 47% use stablecoins to save (Visa survey)
- But: late 2024 shift toward altcoins (speculation) as volumes tripled $50M → $240M+

**Venezuela:**

- Specific stablecoin savings data not available, but remittance use case strong

**Brazil, India, Indonesia (Visa Survey):**

- 47% of crypto users use stablecoins to save

### Average Holding Size?

**No specific data available in search results.** Key challenge: users don't report holdings publicly, platforms don't disclose aggregate data.

**Proxy indicators:**

- Nigeria: 43% of sub-$1M transactions = stablecoins (suggests small-to-medium holdings)
- Argentina: Household use for savings (implies hundreds to thousands of dollars)
- Remittance corridors: $200-500 typical send amounts suggest similar holding sizes

**Conservative estimate (based on remittance/savings patterns):** $100-1,000 per user in developing markets

### What Percentage of Savings?

**No specific data available.** Survey data shows "use for savings" but not percentage allocation.

**Qualitative indicators:**

- Argentina: "Over 60% regularly convert pesos to stablecoins" suggests significant allocation
- Nigeria/Turkey/Venezuela: "Hedging against volatility" implies partial diversification
- High-inflation context: likely 10-30% of liquid savings in stablecoins (not total wealth)

**General CBDC Landscape:**

- 137 countries engaged, 98% of global GDP
- Only 4 fully launched (Bahamas, Nigeria, Jamaica, Zimbabwe)
- Challenge: crypto adoption spurring CBDC development, not vice versa
- Research shows crypto adoption increases probability of CBDC progress (CBDCs following crypto, not replacing it)

**Vietnam Trading Ban (Partial Plateau):**

- Crypto banned as payment (2017, effective 2018)
- Trading effectively banned until late 2025
- Result: $100B+ volume via offshore platforms (Binance, Bybit, P2P)
- Resolution: 5-year pilot launching 2026 with licensed exchanges
- Interpretation: Plateau = policy-induced shift offshore, not demand collapse

### Use Cases That Failed to Materialize

**Search results indicate shift rather than failure:**

**From 2025 review:**

- "Crypto adoption became more selective rather than broader"
- "Retail participation remained muted, but enterprise, institutional, infrastructure adoption increased"
- "Growth shifted from user count to production usage"
- "Market split into utility vs speculation domains"

**Specific Failures:**

- Projects relying on "perfect users, frictionless regulation, fragile trust models"
- "Eventual adoption" promises without real utility
- Token incentive models without underlying value
- Theoretical decentralization without compliance infrastructure

**What this means for developing world:**

- **Failed:** Speculative DeFi projects without real use cases
- **Failed:** "Crypto for everything" narrative (payments replacing all fiat)
- **Failed:** Unregulated exchanges (being shut down or forced offshore)
- **Succeeded:** Stablecoins for specific use cases (remittances, savings, B2B payments)

**Gaming/Gambling Concentration (Speculation, not Utility):**

- Philippines: 19.9% of crypto web traffic = gaming/gambling platforms
- Indonesia: "Crypto degen" community (yield farming, staking) = speculation
- Turkey: Altcoin surge late 2024 ($50M → $240M+) = speculation eclipsing stablecoins

**Interpretation:** Failed use case = "crypto as everyday payment method for all transactions." What works = targeted utility (dollar savings, remittances, freelancer payments)

### Regulatory Barriers That Matter

**India:**

- 30% tax on gains, 1% TDS (transaction deduction)
- No comprehensive framework (2025 ended same as started)
- "Barking without bite" — discussion without action
- Expected 2026: COINS Act, Crypto Assets Regulatory Authority
- **Impact:** Heavy taxation suppresses retail trading, but doesn't stop growth (119M users, $2.36T volume)

**Vietnam:**

- Crypto banned as legal tender (2017/2018)
- Trading ban until late 2025
- **Impact:** Forced $100B+ offshore (Binance, Bybit, P2P). Pilot exchanges launching 2026 with VND 10T capital requirement (~$380M), foreign ownership cap 49%, ~5 licenses initially
- **Barrier:** Capital requirements exclude smaller players

**Philippines:**

- Crackdown on unlicensed platforms
- SEC extended authority (consumer protection, market integrity)
- **Impact:** Forcing consolidation toward regulated exchanges

**Nigeria:**

- Previous: Bank ban on crypto (lifted late 2023)
- Current: ISA 2025 (March) = comprehensive framework under SEC
- **Impact:** Positive — clarity enabled $92.1B volume, but earlier ban period suppressed growth

**Turkey:**

- Stablecoin transfer caps: $3K daily, $50K monthly (higher for Travel Rule compliant)
- CASP licensing requirements (July 2024)
- **Impact:** Moderate — forced compliance, but 24-26M users continued growth

**Brazil:**

- Full regulatory framework effective Feb 2026
- DeCripto reporting (July 2025), OECD CARF compliance
- **Impact:** Increased compliance costs, but 90% stablecoin volume suggests utility persists

**Colombia:**

- DIAN Resolution 000240 (Dec 2025): transactions >$50K trigger alerts
- Enhanced due diligence, automatic tax data sharing
- Draft Bill 510/2025 pending (VASPs)
- **Impact:** Surveillance infrastructure, but $44.2B volume suggests continued activity

**Cross-Cutting:**

- "Additional compliance requirements = higher barriers to entry, higher cost of doing business"
- Capital requirements (Vietnam VND 10T, others similar) exclude smaller platforms
- Tax reporting (India 1% TDS, OECD CARF) creates friction but doesn't stop activity
- **General pattern:** Regulation slows growth, increases costs, forces consolidation — but doesn't eliminate utility-driven adoption

### Infrastructure Gaps (Internet, Banking, Smartphones)

**General Assessment:**

- "Barriers such as lack of infrastructure and digital literacy persist"
- "Widespread adoption in developing markets continues to face challenges related to infrastructure and connectivity"

**Specific Data Limited in Search Results**

**Proxy Indicators:**

**Nigeria:**

- 61M transactions/day on M-Pesa (Kenya) vs 22M crypto users (Nigeria) suggests infrastructure exists
- P2P volume $92.1B indicates workarounds successful

**Kenya:**

- 91% mobile money penetration, 50M+ M-Pesa users
- Infrastructure exists, crypto is additional layer

**Philippines:**

- 94M GCash users, 75% of remittances via digital platforms
- Infrastructure exists

**Indonesia:**

- 20M+ on-exchange accounts
- Infrastructure exists

**Vietnam:**

- $100B+ volume via P2P and offshore
- Infrastructure exists (internet, smartphones), regulatory access was the gap

**India:**

- 119M crypto users
- UPI, eRupi fintech rails accelerate usage
- Infrastructure exists

**Conclusion:**

- **Internet/smartphone access NOT the primary barrier** in top 10 developing countries (these are middle-income, not least-developed)
- **Banking access:** Mobile money, fintech, P2P work around traditional banking gaps
- **Real infrastructure gap:** Custody solutions, compliance automation, developer tools (enterprise infrastructure, not consumer)
- **Digital literacy:** Mentioned but not quantified

**Quote:** "Blockchain-based financial services support inclusion for 1.4 billion unbanked adults globally" — but top 10 countries analyzed are not primarily in this category

### Alternative Solutions Winning (M-Pesa, CBDCs, Local Fintech)

**M-Pesa (Kenya):**

- 91% mobile money penetration (June 2025)
- 50M+ active users
- 61M+ daily transactions
- **Relationship to crypto:** Integration, not competition
  - MOU with M-Pesa (Dec 2025)
  - Stablecoin launch on M-Pesa network (early 2026)
  - M-Pesa Africa + ADI Foundation partnership (Jan 2026)
- **Assessment:** M-Pesa is RAILS for crypto, not alternative. "M-Pesa meets blockchain"

**UPI (India):**

- Developer frustration: M-Pesa seen as "walled garden" vs India's UPI (12,000+ fintechs built on public infrastructure, near-zero costs)
- **India crypto adoption:** 119M users alongside UPI
- **Assessment:** UPI accelerates crypto (fintech rails), not competes

**PIX (Brazil):**

- Instant payment system (launched 2020)
- Crypto platforms integrated (seconds vs days)
- **Brazil crypto adoption:** $318.8B volume, 90% stablecoins
- **Assessment:** PIX enables crypto, not replaces

**CBDCs (As covered above):**

- Nigeria eNaira: 98.5% wallets inactive (failed)
- India e-Rupee: pilot phase, no mass adoption
- Brazil DREX: integration with tokenized assets
- **Assessment:** CBDCs NOT winning vs crypto in developing world (yet)

**Local Fintech (Embedded Finance):**

- Jumia (e-commerce): in-app wallets, BNPL
- Bolt (ride-hailing): in-app wallets
- **Assessment:** Fintech platforms adding crypto features (GCash USDC, Coins.ph PHPC), not competing

**General Pattern:** Local fintech infrastructure (mobile money, instant payments) is ENABLING crypto adoption, not competing. CBDCs failing to gain traction vs crypto stablecoins.

## 5. NUANCED VIEW

### Places Where Crypto Adoption is GROWING for Utility Reasons

**Tier 1: High Utility Growth**

**Nigeria:**

- **Utility:** P2P stablecoin trading (88.5% USDT), inflation hedge (naira instability), remittances
- **Evidence:** $92.1B volume, "growth accelerating," Yellow Card $3B stablecoins
- **Speculation component:** Yes, but stablecoins (43% of sub-$1M transactions) = utility dominance

**Argentina:**

- **Utility:** Dollar savings (61.8% stablecoins), inflation hedge (43.5% inflation), remittance
- **Evidence:** >40% adult adoption, Bitso 4x volume YoY, Lemon $9.3B volume
- **Speculation component:** Shifting (34.54% Lemon reserves = BTC by Nov 2025), but core = utility

**Kenya:**

- **Utility:** Stablecoin remittances ($3.3B), M-Pesa integration (early 2026), cross-border payments
- **Evidence:** #5 globally in stablecoin volume, 43% SSA transactions = stablecoins
- **Speculation component:** Minimal in search results

**Philippines:**

- **Utility:** Remittances ($41B market, 75% digital), freelancer payments, stablecoin savings
- **Evidence:** Coins.ph PHPC expansion, GCash 94M users USDC support, fees 6% → 1%
- **Speculation component:** 19.9% crypto traffic = gaming/gambling (significant speculative layer)

**Vietnam:**

- **Utility:** Remittances, gaming payments, savings
- **Evidence:** 21% population holds crypto (3x global average), described as "everyday infrastructure"
- **Speculation component:** Yes, but $100B+ volume includes significant utility

**Brazil:**

- **Utility:** Stablecoin savings (90% of volume), remittances, cross-border B2B
- **Evidence:** $318.8B volume, PIX integration, regulatory framework enabling growth
- **Speculation component:** Yes, but 90% stablecoin dominance = utility

### Places Where It's Growing for Speculation Only

**Turkey:**

- **Evidence:** Late 2024 altcoin surge $50M → $240M+ (tripling, eclipsing stablecoins)
- **Shift:** From stablecoin hedging (utility) to altcoin trading (speculation)
- **But:** 33% still hold stablecoins, 58% long-term wealth, 37% store of value
- **Assessment:** TRANSITIONING from utility to speculation, not pure speculation

**Indonesia:**

- **Evidence:** "Novelty of crypto and promise of quick profits," "crypto degen community" (yield farming, staking, DeFi)
- **Volume:** Tripled in 2024 to $40B
- **Assessment:** Primarily speculation, limited utility use case data

**South Korea (mentioned in search):**

- **Evidence:** "Traded almost like equities — liquid, speculative, mainstream"
- **Assessment:** Speculation dominance

### Places Where Alternatives (CBDCs, Fintech) Are Better Positioned

**NONE in top 10 developing countries show alternatives winning.**

**Kenya M-Pesa:**

- NOT alternative — integrating with crypto (stablecoin launch early 2026)

**India UPI:**

- NOT alternative — enabling crypto (119M users, fintech rails)

**Brazil PIX:**

- NOT alternative — enabling crypto (crypto platforms integrated)

**Nigeria eNaira:**

- FAILED alternative — 98.5% wallets inactive, replaced by cNGN stablecoin (2025)

**India e-Rupee:**

- PILOT phase, no evidence of better positioning vs crypto (119M crypto users vs pilot CBDC)

**General Assessment:**

- CBDCs: 137 countries developing, only 4 launched, most failing adoption
- Mobile money/instant payments: ENABLING crypto, not replacing
- **No developing country in top 10 shows fintech/CBDC beating crypto for utility use cases**

### Honest Assessment: % Utility vs Speculation

**No single global percentage available in search results. Country-by-country breakdown:**

**High Utility (60-90%):**

- **Nigeria:** 43% stablecoins of sub-$1M (utility proxy), but also trading. Estimate: 60-70% utility
- **Argentina:** 61.8% stablecoins of volume (utility proxy). Estimate: 70-80% utility
- **Kenya:** Stablecoin focus ($3.3B), remittance use case. Estimate: 70-80% utility
- **Philippines:** Remittances + freelancer payments, but 19.9% gaming/gambling. Estimate: 60-70% utility

**Mixed (40-60% utility):**

- **Brazil:** 90% stablecoins (utility), but also significant trading. Estimate: 60-70% utility
- **Vietnam:** "Everyday infrastructure" but also trading. Estimate: 50-60% utility
- **India:** Mix of remittances, trading, diaspora. Estimate: 40-50% utility
- **Colombia:** Stablecoins >50%, inflation hedge. Estimate: 50-60% utility

**Low Utility (20-40%):**

- **Turkey:** Transitioning from stablecoins to altcoins. Estimate: 30-40% utility (declining)
- **Indonesia:** "Crypto degen," speculation focus. Estimate: 20-30% utility

**Overall Developing World Estimate (Weighted by Volume):**

**Utility: 50-60%**
**Speculation: 40-50%**

**Reasoning:**

- Stablecoin market cap: $306B (2025) out of ~$3T total crypto market = 10% of market cap
- But stablecoin transaction volume: $970B/month (Aug 2025), Bitcoin ~$400B/month = stablecoins > Bitcoin in tx volume
- Developing world stablecoin dominance: 43-90% of volume in high-inflation countries
- Remittance volumes: Latin America $161B traditional + $324B crypto stablecoins suggests genuine utility
- BUT: Retail speculation (altcoin trading) still significant in Turkey, Indonesia, Philippines gaming

**2025-2026 Trend:** "Shift from speculation to utility" in global crypto, with emerging markets leading utility adoption.

**Quote:** "Crypto in 2026 is defined by a shift from speculation to utility, with DeFi connecting to real-world assets, NFTs expanding beyond art, GameFi focusing on sustainability, and tokenized RWAs bringing institutions into the space."

**Caveat:** "Dominance of 'potential price increases' as perceived greatest benefit reveals speculation still drives cryptocurrency adoption more than practical utility."

**Conclusion:** Developing world crypto is AHEAD of developed world in utility adoption (stablecoins, remittances, savings), but speculation remains significant minority (30-40%).

## KEY TAKEAWAYS (NUANCED SUMMARY)

### What's Actually Working

1. **Stablecoin remittances:** 50-70% cost reduction, $324B Latin America (+89% YoY), $92.1B Nigeria, $41B Philippines, $63.3B US-Mexico. Clear PMF.

2. **Dollar savings in high-inflation countries:** >40% adult adoption (Argentina, Venezuela), 26M users Nigeria (12% penetration), 61.8% of Argentina crypto volume = stablecoins. Growing, not plateauing.

3. **Freelancer payments:** 60% paid in crypto at least once (2025), Bitwage $4.5B processed, 70% of Argentine freelancers choose stablecoins. Clear PMF.

4. **B2B stablecoin infrastructure:** Yellow Card 30,000 businesses (99% stablecoins), Bitso enterprise, Nexo/Buenbit institutional. Scaling.

5. **Platform success:** Bitso 9M users (tripled in 3 years), Lemon $9.3B volume (+57% YoY), Yellow Card $3B stablecoins, Obiex $9B GTV. Revenue/user growth validates PMF.

### What's Not Working

1. **CBDCs:** Nigeria eNaira 98.5% inactive, India e-Rupee pilot only. Crypto stablecoins winning.

2. **Unregulated speculation:** Projects without compliance infrastructure being shut down or forced offshore.

3. **Crypto as everyday payment for all transactions:** M-Pesa, UPI, PIX still dominate small retail. Crypto = specific use cases (remittances, savings, cross-border), not replacing fiat for groceries.

4. **DeFi/yield farming retail:** Some traction (Indonesia "crypto degen"), but not scaling to mass market in developing world.

### The Complicated Middle

1. **Regulation:** Barriers increase costs (India 30% tax, Vietnam $380M capital requirement, Colombia >$50K alerts), but utility persists. Nigeria ISA 2025 = positive clarity → $92.1B volume.

2. **Speculation vs utility:** 50-60% utility estimate (weighted by volume), but varies by country. Argentina/Nigeria/Kenya = 60-80% utility. Turkey/Indonesia = 20-40% utility (shifting toward speculation).

3. **Infrastructure gaps:** NOT primarily internet/smartphones in top 10 countries (mobile money already scales: 91% Kenya, 94M GCash Philippines). Real gaps: custody solutions, compliance automation, developer tools (enterprise infrastructure).

4. **Alternative solutions:** NOT winning vs crypto. M-Pesa, UPI, PIX = enabling crypto (rails), not competing. CBDCs failing. Local fintech integrating crypto (GCash USDC, Coins.ph PHPC).

5. **Regional differences:**
   - **Latin America:** Utility-dominant (stablecoins 60-90% volume), remittances + savings PMF
   - **Africa:** Utility-dominant (stablecoins 43% SSA transactions), P2P + remittances PMF
   - **Asia:** Mixed (Philippines 60-70% utility, Indonesia 20-30% utility, India 40-50% utility)
   - **Turkey (MENA):** Transitioning from utility (stablecoins) to speculation (altcoins)

### 2025-2026 Trajectory

**Growing:**

- Stablecoin market cap: $306B (2025) → projected $546B (2026)
- Transaction volume: $970B/month (Aug 2025) → $1T/month (2026)
- User growth: Nigeria +30%, Argentina 4x volume, Philippines +6.7%, Vietnam +8.5%, Indonesia +4.4% MoM
- Platform expansion: Yellow Card 34 countries, Bitso 4 markets, Coins.ph multi-region licenses
- Institutional partnerships: Visa + Yellow Card, MoneyGram + Stellar, Nexo + Buenbit, M-Pesa + ADI Foundation

**Plateauing:**

- CBDCs (4 launched globally, most failing adoption)
- Vietnam pre-2026 (forced offshore, but resuming with pilot exchanges)

**Declining:**

- Turkey stablecoin utility (eclipsed by altcoin speculation)
- Unregulated retail platforms (forced consolidation)

### The Honest Assessment

**Developing world crypto adoption is REAL and GROWING, but it's not "crypto replacing everything."**

**What's real:**

- 50-60% of developing world crypto activity = utility (remittances, savings, freelancer payments, B2B)
- Stablecoins = first genuine mass-market crypto use case (300M+ users globally, concentrated in developing world)
- Cost advantages undeniable: 6-10% traditional fees → 0.5-1.5% crypto in remittances
- $324B Latin America (+89% YoY), $205B Sub-Saharan Africa (+52% YoY), $2.36T India (+69% YoY) = not hype

**What's not:**

- 40-50% still speculation (altcoin trading, DeFi degens, gaming/gambling)
- Crypto not replacing M-Pesa, UPI, PIX for small retail transactions
- Infrastructure gaps (custody, compliance) limit institutional scale
- Regulatory barriers slow growth, increase costs (though don't stop utility)

**The nuance:**

- Developing world adoption is AHEAD of developed world in utility (stablecoins for real use cases)
- But speculation hasn't disappeared (Indonesia, Turkey altcoins, Philippines gaming)
- The $300B+ stablecoin market is genuinely solving real problems (inflation, remittance costs, dollar access) for 100M+ people
- This isn't a bubble waiting to pop — it's infrastructure being built, with real revenue (Bitso, Lemon, Yellow Card), real users (119M India, 26M Nigeria stablecoin users), and real cost savings ($300-600/year per migrant household)

**2026 outlook:** Utility adoption continues growing (stablecoins → $546B), speculation consolidates around regulated platforms, traditional finance integrates crypto rails (Visa, MoneyGram), and developing world leads global crypto adoption for practical use cases.
