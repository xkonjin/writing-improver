# Title Craft Research Report

Based on analysis of top newsletters and psychological research on curiosity gaps, here's what makes great titles work for smart audiences.

---

## 1. TITLE ANALYSIS OF THE BEST NEWSLETTERS

### Matt Levine's "Money Stuff"

**Pattern discovered:** Levine uses two distinct approaches:

1. **Dry self-awareness:** "Deutsche Bank Did Some Accounting Stuff", "All Stock Trading Should Be On Exchanges, Say Exchanges"
   - The title IS the joke
   - Works because it's truthful about being mundane
   - The "stuff" diminishes importance while implying insider knowledge

2. **Comma-separated topic lists:** "Killer AI fraud, CFTC sports, art" / "DAT, IPO, GSE, predictions, groceries"
   - No verbs, just nouns
   - Assumes you know what these acronyms mean (creates in-group feeling)
   - Signals density: multiple topics per issue

3. **Catchy with punch:** "Five Bananas Won't Pay the Rent", "Musk's Moonshot Merger"
   - Unexpected specificity ("Five Bananas")
   - Creates mini-narrative

**What makes them work:** Levine's titles reflect his "classic dry and forthright style" - they invite curiosity by being deliberately understated rather than overpromising.

### Byrne Hobart's "The Diff"

**Confirmed title examples:**

- "The Factorio Mindset"
- "Understanding Jane Street"
- "Money, Credit, Trust, and FTX"
- "Hand-Crafted Artisanal Liquidity Provision"
- "Stripe and Solid-State Economics"
- "The Year of Convergence"
- "A Theory of Grift"
- "Composable Companies"
- "Is Everything Getting Old?"
- "Rumor Markets"

**Pattern discovered:**

1. **Named concepts:** "The Factorio Mindset" - creates referenceable framework
2. **Unexpected juxtaposition:** "Hand-Crafted Artisanal Liquidity Provision" - startup language applied to finance
3. **Question format:** "Is Everything Getting Old?" - broad enough to be intriguing, specific enough to answer
4. **Specific + institution:** "Understanding Jane Street" - promises insider knowledge

**What makes them work:** Hobart's process is "iterative: see an interesting pattern, write about it; find a case study of that pattern, write about that case study." His titles name the pattern, not just describe the topic.

### Morgan Housel (Collaborative Fund)

**Confirmed title examples:**

- "Why It's Usually Crazier Than You Expect"
- "Why New Technology Is A Hard Sell"
- "Why Everyone Should Write"
- "The Full Reset"
- "The Big Lessons of the Last Year"
- "Compounding Optimism"
- "Rational vs. Reasonable"
- "What I Read (And Why)"

**Pattern discovered:**

1. **"Why" that implies counterintuitive answer:** Not "Why Technology Is Hard to Sell" but "Why NEW Technology Is A Hard Sell" - the adjective matters
2. **Concept compression:** "Compounding Optimism" - two words that create a framework
3. **Vs. structure:** "Rational vs. Reasonable" - signals nuanced distinction

**What makes them work:** Housel "masterfully blends memes, puns, pop culture, facts, and stories" - his titles promise insight compressed into memorable phrases.

### Ben Thompson's "Stratechery"

**Pattern discovered:**

- "SaaSmageddon and the Future, Microsoft After a Market Correction, Anthropic's Super Bowl Lies"
- "The PLA Purges One Week Later; World Leaders Flock to Beijing; A Trump-Xi Phone Call; Panama Canal Resolution?"

**What makes them work:** Multiple specific topics per title, semicolon-separated. Creates FOMO (if you don't know what "SaaSmageddon" refers to, you're out of the loop). Sometimes includes neologisms ("SaaSmageddon").

### Packy McCormick's "Not Boring"

**Confirmed examples:**

- "The Electric Slide"
- "Excel Never Dies"
- "a16z: The Power Brokers"

**Pattern:** Mixes pop culture references with serious business analysis. "The Electric Slide" is both a dance and about electric vehicles. Creates tension between playful and serious.

## 2. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CURIOSITY GAPS

### Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory (1994)

**Core finding:** Curiosity arises from perceiving a gap between what you know and what you want to know. The gap must be:

- **Large enough** to feel meaningful
- **Small enough** to feel bridgeable
- **Specific enough** to know what you're missing

**Application to titles:** A title should tell you ENOUGH to know what knowledge you lack, but not enough to close the gap.

### Curiosity Gap vs. Clickbait

**Research findings (2025 studies):**

**The critical distinction:** "If you provide your audience with the information they want to know," it's a curiosity gap. "Otherwise your curiosity gap is no longer a curiosity gap; it's clickbait."

**What makes clickbait fail:** "Clickbait headlines might raise curiosity or annoyance" - they "promise to quickly close the knowledge gap" but don't deliver. Modern algorithms "punish Clickbait heavily. If you open a huge gap and fail to close it, your Retention Rate plummets."

**Optimal gap size (Meta-analysis of 8,977 headline experiments):**

- **Too vague:** "When the baseline headline is too vague, higher headline concreteness increases clickthrough rates"
- **Sweet spot:** "Corroborates the idea of a curvilinear relationship" - inverted U-curve
- **Too specific:** If you answer the question in the title, curiosity dies

**Optimal length:** 7-11 words (not 5 words anymore)

### What Smart Audiences Want

**Key finding:** "Clickbait headlines are more likely to raise curiosity when they are perceived as creative" - sophistication matters.

Smart readers want:

- **Insider signals** (terminology that shows you understand the domain)
- **Specificity** (numbers, names, concrete details)
- **Counterintuition** (challenge assumptions)
- **Frameworks** (named concepts they can reference)

---

## 3. TITLE PATTERNS THAT WORK FOR SMART AUDIENCES

### Named Concepts (Creating Referenceable Terms)

**Examples found:**

- "The Factorio Mindset" (Byrne Hobart)
- "The Great Unbundling" (Ben Thompson, 2017)
- "Compounding Optimism" (Morgan Housel)
- "Engels' Pause" (economic history concept)

**Why it works:** Gives readers language to think with. After reading "The Factorio Mindset," they can say "that's a Factorio Mindset problem" in other contexts.

### Surprising Juxtapositions

**Examples found:**

- "Hand-Crafted Artisanal Liquidity Provision" (Byrne Hobart) - startup language + finance
- "Five Bananas Won't Pay the Rent" (Matt Levine) - absurd specificity
- "Excel Never Dies" (Packy McCormick) - contradicts "move fast and break things" ethos

**Why it works:** Forces brain to reconcile unexpected combination. Creates memorable cognitive dissonance.

### Specific + Unexpected

**Real-world examples from research:**

- Circle paid Coinbase **$907.9 million in distribution fees in 2024**, which was **54% of Circle's revenue**
- **67% decline** in entry-level developer jobs between 2023-2024
- Alpha Picks' stock picks are **up 1,500%** (biggest winner)

**The pattern:** Specific number + counterintuitive implication. "$908 Million" is more concrete than "a lot of money." 54% is surprising because it means Circle pays most of their revenue to a distributor.

### Questions That Imply Counterintuitive Answers

**Examples found:**

- "Is Everything Getting Old?" (Byrne Hobart)
- "Why New Technology Is A Hard Sell" (Morgan Housel)

**Why it works:** The question format signals "the obvious answer is wrong." If new technology were obviously a hard sell, you wouldn't need an article.

### Metaphors From Unexpected Domains

**Examples:**

- "The Factorio Mindset" - video game → business operations
- "Solid-State Economics" - physics → payments infrastructure
- "The Electric Slide" - dance → electric vehicles

**Why it works:** Domain transfer forces fresh perspective. Seeing payments through a physics lens reveals patterns you'd miss with business metaphors.

## 4. TITLE PATTERNS THAT FAIL (AI-GENERATED STYLE)

### Research on AI vs. Human Titles (2025)

**AI patterns detected:**

- "Repetitive or stereotypical phrases or patterns"
- "Narrow and uniform pattern despite generating polished, fluent prose"
- "More uniformity in word choice and rhythm"
- "Recycles patterns from its training data, resulting in derivative ideas that feel secondhand"

**Human patterns:**

- "Greater stylistic range, shaped by personal voice, creative intent, and individual experience"
- "Unique metaphors or insights born from lived reality"
- "Greater stylistic diversity and individuality"

### Specific Patterns That Scream AI

**"The X That Will Y"**

- Example: "The Technology That Will Transform Finance"
- Why it fails: Vague subject, vague verb, overpromises

**"How X Is Transforming Y"**

- Example: "How AI Is Transforming Software Development"
- Why it fails: Present continuous tense suggests ongoing process with no specific insight

**"Why X Matters More Than You Think"**

- Why it fails: Condescending. Implies reader doesn't understand importance. Generic.

**"Ultimate Guide," "Deep Dive," "Comprehensive"**

- Why it fails: These are META-descriptions (describing the format, not the insight)
- Smart readers want the insight, not a label about coverage

### What Makes a Title Feel Human

**Specificity over abstraction:**

- AI: "The Impact of Distribution on Stablecoin Economics"
- Human: "Circle Pays Coinbase 54% of Revenue"

**Personal angle:**

- AI: "Understanding Banking Relationships in Fintech"
- Human: "This is the part I keep underestimating" (actual line from your article)

**Unexpected choices:**

- AI: Uses the most common word for a concept
- Human: "Hand-Crafted Artisanal Liquidity Provision" (nobody taught an AI to be sarcastically artisanal)

---

## 5. REVEAL THE INSIGHT vs. POINT TOWARD IT

### The Spectrum

**REVEAL (Left side):**

- "Circle Pays Coinbase 54% of Revenue"
- "Entry-Level Developer Jobs Fell 67% in One Year"
- Pro: Immediate value, concrete fact, shareable
- Con: Less curiosity, might not get click

**POINT TOWARD (Right side):**

- "What Actually Differentiates a Stablecoin Business"
- "The Missing Rung"
- Pro: Creates curiosity gap
- Con: Vague, might feel like withholding

**SWEET SPOT (Middle):**

- "The Factorio Mindset" - names something without explaining it
- "Hand-Crafted Artisanal Liquidity Provision" - you know it's about liquidity AND that there's irony
- "Why New Technology Is A Hard Sell" - reveals the thesis, not the argument

### How to Compress Complex Insight Into 3-8 Words

**Your Article 1 Insight:**
"Circle pays 54% of revenue to Coinbase in distribution; this velocity-vs-float split explains everything about USDC vs USDT"

**Compression strategy:**

1. **Find the unexpected number:** 54%
2. **Identify the surprising relationship:** Circle (issuer) → Coinbase (distributor)
3. **Name the underlying pattern:** velocity vs. float (this is the conceptual contribution)

**Your Article 2 Insight:**
"AI capability improves in months but institutional adaptation takes decades; we're entering a new Engels' Pause where GDP grows but wages stagnate"

**Compression strategy:**

1. **Name the historical parallel:** Engels' Pause
2. **Identify the timescale mismatch:** months vs. decades
3. **Focus on the human impact:** wages, not just GDP

### The Difference Between Naming and Describing

**DESCRIBING (what most writers do):**

- "The Challenges of Stablecoin Distribution"
- "AI's Impact on Employment"
- Generic, forgettable, no referenceable concept

**NAMING (what great writers do):**

- "The Factorio Mindset" - now you can reference this concept
- "Engels' Pause" - compresses 50 years of economic history
- "The Missing Rung" - names the specific problem (ladder with no next step)

**Your opportunity:** Your articles have NAMED INSIGHTS ("velocity vs. float", "the two timescales") but current titles are descriptive, not evocative.

## 6. TITLE OPTIONS FOR YOUR ARTICLES

### ARTICLE 1: Stablecoin Distribution Economics

**Core insight:** Circle pays 54% of revenue to Coinbase; velocity vs. float explains USDC vs USDT difference

#### CONSERVATIVE OPTIONS (7-8/10 on curiosity scale)

1. **"What Actually Differentiates a Stablecoin Business"**
   - Current title - safe, clear, professional
   - WORKS: Signals insider knowledge ("actually" implies common misconception)
   - FAILS: Generic structure, feels like a listicle

2. **"The Banking Problem Nobody Talks About"**
   - WORKS: Creates gap ("nobody talks about" = you're missing something)
   - FAILS: Vague, could be any banking problem

3. **"Circle's $908 Million Distribution Bill"**
   - WORKS: Specific dollar amount, creates "wait, what?" moment
   - FAILS: Sounds like news, not analysis

#### BALANCED OPTIONS (8-9/10 on curiosity scale)

4. **"Velocity vs. Float"**
   - WORKS: Names the framework, implies deep concept
   - FAILS: Too abstract without context, might seem academic

5. **"The Stablecoin Issuer Stack"**
   - WORKS: "Stack" is tech insider term, implies layers/complexity
   - FAILS: Descriptive, not provocative

6. **"Why Circle Pays Half Its Revenue to Coinbase"**
   - WORKS: Specific fact, "why" promises explanation, counterintuitive
   - FAILS: Reveals too much (closes curiosity gap)

7. **"The Thing That Trips Up Stablecoin Launches"**
   - WORKS: Insider perspective, promise of non-obvious insight
   - FAILS: "Thing" is vague (though sometimes vagueness works - see "Money Stuff")

#### BOLD OPTIONS (9-10/10 on curiosity scale)

8. **"Hand-Crafted Artisanal Stablecoin Issuance"**
   - WORKS: Hobart-style irony, signals "it's harder than it looks"
   - FAILS: Might be TOO clever, obscures topic for casual browsers

9. **"Circle's Coinbase Problem"**
   - WORKS: Provocative, names the dynamic, implies power imbalance
   - FAILS: Might feel tabloid-y, oversimplifies the relationship

10. **"The Part Everyone Underestimates"**
    - WORKS: Direct callback to your actual writing voice ("This is the part I keep underestimating")
    - FAILS: Maximum vagueness, only works if reader trusts you already

**RECOMMENDATION:** Go with #6 or #7. They're specific enough to set expectations while creating genuine curiosity. #9 is the boldest choice if you want maximum engagement.

---

### ARTICLE 2: AI Capabilities vs. Institutional Adaptation

**Core insight:** AI improves in months, institutions adapt in decades; new Engels' Pause ahead

#### CONSERVATIVE OPTIONS (7-8/10 on curiosity scale)

1. **"The Two Timescales"**
   - Current title - clear, conceptual
   - WORKS: Implies framework, suggests comparing two different speeds
   - FAILS: Extremely vague, doesn't signal the stakes

2. **"Why Goldman and Acemoglu Are Both Right"**
   - WORKS: Names authorities, implies reconciliation of contradiction
   - FAILS: Only works if reader knows both predictions

3. **"The Fast Clock and the Slow Clock"**
   - WORKS: More evocative than "two timescales," creates parallel structure
   - FAILS: Still abstract, doesn't signal human impact

#### BALANCED OPTIONS (8-9/10 on curiosity scale)

4. **"The New Engels' Pause"**
   - WORKS: Names historical parallel, implies wages/GDP disconnect
   - FAILS: Only works if reader knows the original Engels' Pause

5. **"Where Did the Entry-Level Jobs Go?"**
   - WORKS: Question format, specific phenomenon, relatable anxiety
   - FAILS: Might sound like career advice, not economic analysis

6. **"The Missing Rung"**
   - WORKS: Metaphor from your article, implies ladder with no next step
   - FAILS: Too abstract without article context

7. **"67% in One Year"**
   - WORKS: Specific shocking number, creates immediate "what is this about?"
   - FAILS: Number without context might feel clickbait-y

#### BOLD OPTIONS (9-10/10 on curiosity scale)

8. **"Growing Employment, Falling Wages"**
   - WORKS: Paradox format (these shouldn't go together), historical parallel clear
   - FAILS: Sounds academic, might not signal AI is the topic

9. **"The Technology Arrives in Months. The Reorganization Takes Decades."**
   - WORKS: Reveals core thesis, creates tension, specific timeframes
   - FAILS: Long (13 words), might give away too much

10. **"What Happens When AI Gets Better at Building AI"**
    - WORKS: Question format, recursive problem, feels urgent
    - FAILS: Might feel speculative/futurist rather than analytical

**RECOMMENDATION:** Go with #9 (bold, thesis-revealing) or #4 (if you trust readers know the reference). #8 is the smartest option if you want to emphasize the economic history parallel. #10 works if you want to lead with the acceleration dynamic.
