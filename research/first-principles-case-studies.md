# First-Principles Methodologies Applied to Writing Improver's Published Work

Case studies showing how the frameworks in this research appear (implicitly and explicitly) in articles 02-06.

---

## ARTICLE 02: "Velocity vs. Float" (Stablecoins + AI Capex)

### Methodologies Present

**Munger's Latticework:**
- Economics: Where does capital flow? Who pays for AI?
- History: Eurodollars comparison (offshore float dynamics)
- Regulation: What policy changes enable stablecoin yield?
- Mechanism: How do T-bill yields connect to stablecoin float?

**Falsificationism:**
- Candidate thesis: "Stablecoins are just banks' solution to AI capex financing"
- Counter-evidence sought: Do banks actually need stablecoins for this? (Surprise answer: they don't use them directly; crypto markets do)
- Updated thesis: "Stablecoins solve the problem of US-offshore float arbitrage when rates are inverted"

**Kolmogorov Complexity:**
Core insight (50 words): "Stablecoins retain float (T-bills earning 5%) while banks can't (deposits earning 0% cost them 4% in spread loss). That $122B float is Tether's edge, whether it's explicit reserve or implicit financing."

### What Worked

- Thesis required specific numbers (T-bill yields, reserve amounts, cost structure)
- Remove any number and thesis weakens
- Explanation avoids analogy; uses direct mechanism

### What Could Have Been Stronger

- Could have explicitly tested: "What if T-bills were in crypto natively? Why do stablecoins still win?"
- Could have applied Feynman test more rigorously: "Explain stablecoin reserve adequacy to someone who doesn't know what a T-bill is"

## ARTICLE 03: "The Two Timescales" (AI Cognition)

### Methodologies Present

**Inversion (Munger):**
- Standard question: "How will AI change human work?"
- Inverted question: "How will humans be forced to change because AI changed?"
- Result: Two-layer framework (AI timescale vs human adaptation timescale)

**Falsificationism:**
- Candidate thesis: "AI will accelerate technical change, forcing human adaptation"
- Counter-evidence: If humans can retrain faster than AI improves, thesis is false
- Supporting evidence: Skill half-life data, METR cognitive benchmarks, training timescale measurements

**Feynman Mechanism Test:**
- Successfully explains: "Why humans can't keep up" (not jargon, causal chain)
- Mechanism: cognitive load → training latency → skill obsolescence

### Kolmogorov Complexity

Core insight (50 words): "AI capability doubles every 8-18 months. Human skill retraining takes 2-4 years. The gap grows exponentially. By 2026, the problem shifts from 'what skills matter' to 'can humans retrain fast enough at all.'"

### What Worked

- Inverted the question (asking backwards revealed the real insight)
- Used specific metrics (METR 39-point gap in benchmarks)
- Mechanism is temporal, not just technological

### What Could Have Been Stronger

- Could have explicitly falsified: "If human retraining can compress below 18 months, what evidence would show it?"
- Could have applied Bridgewater disagreement: What do education experts say about retraining timescales?

## ARTICLE 04: "Compression Substitution" (AI Impact on Knowledge Work)

### Methodologies Present

**Latticework (Munger):**
- Economics: What happens to wages when supply of "compressed knowledge" floods market?
- Psychology: Why do humans value "original" knowledge over "compressed" knowledge?
- History: How did printing press, radio, and TV compress knowledge? What happened to the knowledge workers?
- Mechanism: How does compression change the economics of knowledge work?

**Falsificationism (Popper):**
- Candidate thesis: "AI compresses knowledge, which substitutes human knowledge workers"
- Falsifying test: "If knowledge is still scarce after compression, thesis is false"
- Evidence: Checking if compressed knowledge creates surplus or if demand still exceeds supply

**Novelty Testing:**
- Is this framework application or data-driven?
- Answer: Partly framework (economics of information), partly data (compression metrics from benchmarks)
- Risk: Could have read "obvious from econ theory alone"
- Fix: Anchored to specific METR metrics (39-point gap) to ground in data

### Kolmogorov Complexity

Core insight (50 words): "Compression reduces knowledge work's value because it replaces human explanation with machine explanation. History shows compressed knowledge always commoditizes: printing→mass literacy→smaller writer premiums. AI compression follows the same path."

### What Worked

- Historical parallels make it feel less predictable
- Specific mechanism (compression as commoditization) rather than vague "AI replaces X"

### Issues Found (from CLAUDE.md memory)

- Passed all structural gates at 6.5/10
- Still sounded AI despite avoiding surface tells
- Problem: The framework (compression = commoditization) is reusable template
- Fix needed: More specific data points to break reusability

## ARTICLE 05: Unpublished (Test Case)

### Why This Case Study Matters

Article 05 wasn't published because it failed the "What's Genuinely Novel Here?" test mid-writing. Let's analyze why:

**Framework application error:**
- Started with: "X industry follows disruption pattern Y (Christensen)"
- Problem: Any industry entering digital markets could follow the same pattern
- Reusability: "Cloud computing is disruption." "Autonomous vehicles are disruption." "AI is disruption."
- Result: Medium Kolmogorov complexity, not publishing-quality novelty

**Lesson:** This is why your Lesson 11 (CLAUDE.md) exists: "An article can score 10.0/10 on metrics while being completely obvious."

**How this framework would have caught it:**
1. Academic novelty test: "Does this thesis change how people think, or just apply known framework?"
2. Falsification test: "What would make this thesis false?" (Answer: If Christensen's model didn't apply — but it always does by definition, so the test is circular)
3. Kolmogorov test: Can this be said in 50 words without the framework? If yes, the framework isn't adding novelty.

## ARTICLE 06: "The Settlers Lobbied for Terraforming" (Crypto Narrative)

### Methodologies Present

**Latticework (All Six Mental Models):**
- **Psychology:** Why did traders buy into dragon PFP narrative? What made BCH wars feel existential?
- **Economics:** NFT floor prices, trading volume, margin dynamics, wealth distribution
- **History:** Gaming economies (Runescape), prior crypto narratives (Monero, Dash), gambling industry parallels
- **Regulation:** Who stands to profit from terraforming narratives? Who loses?
- **Mechanism:** How do narratives create trading behavior? How do PFPs signal in-group membership?
- **Inversion:** What would kill the narrative? (Regulatory ban, wealth concentration becoming visible, alternative narrative emergence)

**Falsificationism:**
- Candidate thesis: "Crypto narratives are terraforming—reshaping incentive structures for the people who buy them"
- Falsifying tests:
  - If traders don't profit from buying into narratives, thesis is false
  - If narratives don't change behavior, thesis is false
  - If this is just standard hype cycles, thesis is false (not specific to crypto)
- Evidence survived: Specific traders (Boryoku Dragonz community) shaped policy, not vice versa

**Feynman Mechanism Test:**
- "Explain why traders buy dragon PFPs" → "They hope PFP price rises because others will buy" (circular, not mechanism)
- Real mechanism: "Traders buy PFPs because the in-group narrative (Boryoku = wealth generation in Mars colony) creates shared identity, which creates coordination, which creates floor-price protection"

**Surprise Testing:**
- Genuine mismatch: Readers expect crypto narratives are top-down marketing. Reality: bottom-up community narrates reality into existence.
- Foreshadowing: Article opens with Runescape pseudonyms (hints that games shape identity, which shapes economics)
- Falsifiability: "If trader interviews show narratives don't drive behavior, thesis fails" (tested against available interviews)

### Kolmogorov Complexity

Core insight (50 words): "Crypto communities (Runescape→BCH→Doge→PEPE→dragon PFPs) don't just adopt narratives; they *create* them to justify wealth concentration they've already participated in. The narrative isn't the cause of price movement; it's the post-hoc rationalization that prevents capitulation."

### Novelty Achievement

- **Data-driven:** Required specific trader interviews, price history, community documents
- **Remove data, thesis collapses:** If dragon PFP traders didn't actually coordinate, if narratives didn't emerge organically, if prices were manipulated top-down instead, thesis fails
- **Doesn't apply everywhere:** This mechanism is specific to crypto's pseudonymous, narrative-driven market structure
- **Falsifiable:** "If next crypto narrative emerges top-down (celebrity endorsement), thesis is falsified"

### Personal Layer as Anti-AI Shield

Your Lesson 14 (CLAUDE.md): The 4-paragraph opening (Runescape → Poloniex → BCH wars → Boryoku) makes the article unfakeable. This isn't just application of frameworks to data. This is lived experience:

- Only someone who *actually watched* the BCH wars unfold could write "WOW MONERO WOW DASH"
- Only someone who *actually held* bags could write about "Stellar bags you never meant to hold"
- Only someone who *tracked* community discord could write about specific PFP communities shaping price

**Why this matters for first-principles frameworks:**
The "personal layer" is actually a manifestation of **Feynman's mechanism principle**. You can't fake mechanism if it's grounded in your lived experience of how it actually works. The AI can't generate authentic mechanism because it hasn't experienced the feedback loops.

## SYNTHESIS: Why the Frameworks Are Already Working

Looking at articles 02-06, the frameworks appear implicitly:

| Framework | Where It Appears | How to Make Explicit |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Munger Latticework | Research phase (agent diversity) | Assign agents to mental models, document which model generated which finding |
| Falsificationism | Testing phase (counter-evidence) | Add explicit "Thesis Falsifier" agent that lists conditions that would break the thesis |
| Feynman Mechanism | Draft phase (explanation without jargon) | Gate before voice editing: can you explain each major claim in 2 sentences without jargon? |
| Novelty Testing | Quality gates (metric checks) | Add "Is this data-driven or framework-applied?" question before synthesis |
| Surprise Testing | Structural scan (checking for AI tells) | Add "Does this create genuine mismatch or just restate data?" before final revision |
| Kolmogorov | Final revision (voice + density) | Add explicit gate: state core insight in <50 words or rewrite |
| Bridgewater Disagreement | Missing | Add "devil's advocate" review phase |

## NEXT: What to Build

The research you've done already works. The enhancement is making it **explicit and systematic**:

1. **Map agents explicitly to Munger's models** (currently implicit in agent design)
2. **Add falsification phase** (currently happens ad-hoc during research)
3. **Add novelty tester agent** (currently judged manually at synthesis)
4. **Add mechanism validator** (currently part of voice editing, not separate)
5. **Add surprise verifier** (currently part of structural scan)
6. **Add Kolmogorov scorer** (currently done manually)

The frameworks you discovered through research aren't new to your system—they're the underlying principles your best work already follows. The task is systematization.
