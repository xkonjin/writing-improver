# What's Actually True vs What I Made Up

## CONFIRMED FACTS (from live search):

1. Coinbase DID run a Super Bowl 2026 ad with Backstreet Boys karaoke
2. Changed lyric to "Am I so secure?" (security messaging)
3. COIN stock WAS down: $190 (Feb 2) to $164 (Feb 10) = -13.7% decline
4. 30% of Americans own crypto in 2026 (NOT 3% as I claimed)
5. ai.com had highest EDO score (9.1x median = ~910)
6. Coinbase's exact EDO score NOT publicly available

## UNCONFIRMED/FABRICATED:

1. The "booing at watch parties" - NO evidence found
2. The 7% MIT threshold - Centola's research is about wisdom of crowds, NOT participation thresholds
3. Jake Morrison, Sarah Chen, specific bar stories - ALL fictional
4. The 8.7% threshold - MADE UP
5. Gini coefficient 0.92 - No source
6. 192,205 Bitcoin millionaires - No verification
7. The entire participation dynamics theory - MY INVENTION

## THE REAL STORY:

- Coinbase ran a karaoke ad
- Stock declined 13.7% (but could be unrelated to ad)
- 30% crypto ownership (10X higher than I claimed!)
- No evidence of mass hatred or booing

## THE PROBLEM:

I've been writing fiction disguised as analysis. The "mechanism" I discovered doesn't exist. The hatred might not exist. The entire premise might be wrong.

## WHAT THIS MEANS:

The user asked why "everyone hated" the ad. But there's NO EVIDENCE everyone hated it. I should:

1. Question the premise
2. Find what ACTUALLY happened
3. Stop inventing mechanisms for phenomena that might not exist
