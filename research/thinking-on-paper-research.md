# Thinking on Paper vs. Presenting Research

## The Core Distinction

**Writer-based prose** (Linda Flower, 1979): "The record and the working of the writer's thought processes." Writing composed for oneself that offers up versions of the writer's own thought process.

**Reader-based prose**: Writing adapted to the rhetorical problem at hand — organized for the audience, not for the writer's discovery process.

**AI text is reader-based by default.** It has already done the thinking and is explaining the conclusion. It lacks the structural markers of discovery because it never actually discovers anything. This is the formal name for our "presenting vs thinking" diagnosis.

Peter Elbow: "Think of writing not as a way to transmit a message but as a way to grow and cook a message." College writing assignments focus on "thesis support instead of thesis seeking."

## The Montaigne Method

Montaigne's essays are "the painting of thought" — "we are guided along the contours of the mind in motion, with the writer thinking and discovering as he writes."

Key structural feature: Essays are "often **severed at the moment Montaigne senses he is approaching a conclusion**." This is the formal equivalent of our Rule 9 (no summarizing endings).

His motto "Que sais-je?" (What do I know?) defines the essay as fundamentally a question rather than an answer.

## Open Loops

A specific technique for creating discovery-feeling prose:

- Introduce a question or idea early
- Move to something else
- Return to close it 3-4 paragraphs later
- Keep multiple loops open at different timescales
- "As loops are closed, new ones get opened" — creating a web of interconnected ideas that mimics actual thinking

The Zeigarnik Effect: unfinished tasks occupy our minds more than completed ones. Open loops pull attention forward.

## Earning Realizations

"The challenge in writing a moment of clarity is that you need to earn it through accrual, buildup, and crescendo. It's a hallmark of novice writing that realizations crop up out of nowhere." (Storm Writing School)

Effective structure:

1. A problem begins as a vague feeling of unrest
2. The writer attempts to address the problem but finds each subsequent solution inadequate
3. The moment of clarity comes when something in the external world brings the subconscious to consciousness

This maps directly to Rule 4 (key insight appears 60-70% through section, not at start).

## New Journalism Techniques for Converting Research into Discovery Prose

Tom Wolfe's four devices:

1. **Scene-by-scene construction** — witness events, recreate for reader
2. **Full dialogue** — not just quotations
3. **Point-of-view narration** — present through characters' perspectives
4. **Status details** — surroundings and possessions as "social autopsy"

Gay Talese: "Intensive reportage took the form of interior monologue to discover from his subjects what they were thinking." Despite literary techniques: "It was indeed reporting — 'Fact reporting, leg work.'" The difference is in presentation, not accuracy.

## Why Academic Norms Kill Voice

Steven Pinker (Curse of Knowledge): "It simply doesn't occur to them that their readers don't know what they know — that those readers haven't mastered the patois or can't divine the missing steps that seem too obvious to mention."

Academic writing standards "remove or 'kill' not only the creativity of the student-writers but also their own voice."

## Actionable Patterns

1. **Open loops at multiple scales** — micro (closed in next paragraph) and macro (spanning sections)
2. **Strategic digression** — tangents that seem peripheral but connect back later
3. **Earn realizations through buildup** — don't state conclusions up front
4. **Asymmetric attention** — 5 paragraphs on what's interesting, 1 sentence on what's obvious
5. **Leave questions open** — explicitly state what you don't know
6. **Scene-based over summary-based** — show a specific moment rather than generalizing
7. **Change direction based on evidence** — show thinking evolving
8. **Concrete before abstract** — start with specific examples, build to general principles
9. **Genuine uncertainty markers** — "I think...", "It seems like...", "Maybe..."
