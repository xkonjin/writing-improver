## 3. High-Performing Stablecoin/Payments Content

### The Data That Goes Viral

The single most-shared stablecoin data point of 2025 came from the **a16z "State of Crypto 2025" report**:

> "Stablecoins have done $46 trillion in total transaction volume in the last year -- nearly 3x Visa and approaching the ACH network."

This stat (with the caveat that adjusted volume is ~$9 trillion after filtering bots) was everywhere: LinkedIn posts, newsletter lead-ins, conference slides, and Twitter threads. It crystallizes the "stablecoins are real infrastructure" narrative in a single number.

**Other viral data points:**

- Stablecoin market cap crossing $300 billion (symbolic milestone)
- 41% of corporate users reporting 10%+ cost savings vs. traditional methods
- 77% of corporates interested in paying suppliers cross-border via stablecoins
- GENIUS Act passage leading to transaction volumes surging to $10B (up from $6B)

### Content Formats That Work

#### 1. "The Infrastructure Thesis" Essays

Long-form pieces arguing that stablecoins are evolving from "crypto plumbing" to "payments infrastructure" consistently perform well. Examples:

- a16z's "6 trends for 2026: Stablecoins, payments, and real-world assets"
- McKinsey's "The Stable Door Opens: How Tokenized Cash Enables Next-Gen Payments"
- Fireblocks' "State of Stablecoins 2025: The Payments Infrastructure Reset"
- Castle Island Ventures' emerging market stablecoin research (2,500 person study across 5 countries)

**Why it works:** It reframes stablecoins from "crypto speculation" to "enterprise infrastructure" -- which makes it shareable in corporate Slack channels without the crypto stigma.

#### 2. Real Company Use Case Stories

The most engaging content shows real companies using stablecoins for actual business operations:

- **SpaceX** using stablecoins to collect Starlink payments in countries with underdeveloped financial systems
- **PayPal** completing an on-chain invoice payment to EY using PYUSD
- **Stripe's $1.1B acquisition of Bridge** (stablecoin infrastructure)
- **Western Union** announcing its own stablecoin (USDPT) at Money 20/20
- **Klarna** launching KlarnaUSD
- **Meta** exploring stablecoin payments for Instagram creators

**Why it works:** Named companies with specific use cases are inherently more credible and shareable than abstract market analysis.

#### 3. Regulatory Milestone Content

The GENIUS Act (enacted July 2025) generated massive content engagement:

- Analysis of what the first comprehensive stablecoin regulatory framework means
- "Before and after" metrics showing volume surges post-regulation
- International comparison content (US GENIUS Act vs. EU MiCA)

**Why it works:** Regulatory clarity is the #1 concern for enterprise adoption -- content that helps people understand the new rules gets forwarded to legal and compliance teams.

#### 4. Data Visualizations & Charts

Content that packages stablecoin data into shareable graphics performs exceptionally:

- Transaction volume comparisons (stablecoins vs. Visa vs. PayPal vs. ACH)
- Market cap growth trajectories
- Cross-border payment cost comparisons (stablecoin vs. traditional rails)
- Adoption curves by use case

**Why it works:** Self-contained visuals that tell a story in one screenshot are the most "Slack-shareable" format.

#### 5. The "Stablecoin Sandwich" Explainer Format

Content explaining how stablecoins fit into existing payment flows (fiat in -> stablecoin transfer -> fiat out) has resonated strongly:

- Shows practical integration rather than crypto-utopian replacement
- Addresses the "how does this actually work?" question enterprises have
- Makes the technology feel incremental rather than revolutionary

### Topics That Get the Most Engagement

Ranked by observed engagement across newsletters, LinkedIn, and Twitter:

1. **Cross-border B2B payments** -- The killer app narrative. 77% corporate interest, real cost savings data.
2. **Bank stablecoin launches** -- Every announcement (JPMorgan JPM Coin, Western Union USDPT, Klarna KlarnaUSD) generates massive discussion.
3. **Regulatory developments** -- GENIUS Act, MiCA, international regulatory comparisons.
4. **Real-time settlement** -- 48% cite this as the #1 edge (not lower fees, which is counterintuitive and therefore shareable).
5. **AI + stablecoins intersection** -- Agentic commerce, micropayments, AI-native business models.
6. **Emerging market adoption** -- The "dollarization" narrative with real data from Castle Island research.

### What Does NOT Work

- Generic "crypto is the future" content without specific data or use cases
- Technical blockchain content without business context
- Content that conflates stablecoins with speculative crypto trading
- Posts that don't acknowledge the legitimate concerns (custody risk, regulatory uncertainty pre-GENIUS Act)

## 4. Newsletter Platforms & Tech Stacks

### Platform Comparison for Fintech Newsletters

#### Substack

**Used by:** Fintech Takes, Fintech Business Weekly, Fintech Blueprint, Fintech Brainfood, Fintech Wrap Up, Net Interest, Not Boring, Bankless

**Pros:**

- Free to use regardless of list size (no monthly fees)
- Built-in discovery network helps new subscribers find you
- Substack app and recommendations drive organic growth
- Simple, clean reading experience that fintech audiences appreciate
- Notes feature enables community engagement
- Strong network effects among finance/fintech readers

**Cons:**

- Takes 10% of paid subscription revenue
- Very limited subscriber data -- no segmentation, minimal analytics on acquisition sources
- Limited design customization
- No native ad network or referral program tools
- You don't fully "own" the relationship (Substack controls the platform)

**Best for:** Solo creators and small teams who prioritize writing quality over growth engineering. The 10% cut is worth it if you're relying on Substack's discovery network for growth.

**Fintech-specific note:** The finance/fintech category on Substack is one of the strongest, meaning the recommendation network actually works for this niche. Most top fintech newsletters are on Substack for this reason.

#### Beehiiv

**Used by:** Growing number of fintech newsletters, especially growth-focused ones

**Pros:**

- No platform fee on paid subscriptions (you keep 100%)
- Built-in ad network with CPM/CPC monetization from day one
- "Boosts" marketplace for cross-promoting with other newsletters (has paid out $5M+ total)
- Native referral program tools
- Advanced analytics and segmentation
- Custom website/blog capability
- A/B testing for subject lines and content

**Cons:**

- $79-$149/month for 5,000 subscribers (paid plans required for growth features)
- No built-in discovery network -- you drive your own traffic
- Less established in the fintech niche specifically
- Newer platform, still building reputation

**Best for:** Creators who want to run newsletters as a business with multiple revenue streams (ads, sponsorships, paid subscriptions, boosts). The growth and monetization tools are significantly more advanced than Substack.

**Fintech-specific note:** The ad network and Boosts are particularly valuable in fintech because fintech advertisers pay premium CPMs ($50-$100+ for B2B fintech audiences). A fintech newsletter on Beehiiv can monetize free subscribers through ads much more effectively than on Substack.

#### Ghost

**Used by:** More technical/developer-focused publications, some fintech blogs

**Pros:**

- Open source, self-hostable
- 0% transaction fees on memberships
- Full design customization (it's a proper CMS)
- Doubles as blog + newsletter + membership platform
- You own everything -- data, content, subscriber relationships
- Integrates with any email delivery provider

**Cons:**

- More technical to set up and maintain (especially self-hosted)
- No discovery network
- No built-in ad network or referral tools
- Managed hosting (Ghost Pro) is $9-$199/month
- Self-hosting requires server management

**Best for:** Technically savvy publishers who want full ownership and customization. Good for publications that need a website + blog + newsletter in one tool.

**Fintech-specific note:** Good choice if you're building a media brand that goes beyond just a newsletter (e.g., you want a content hub with reports, tools, and newsletter). Less ideal for pure newsletter distribution.

#### ConvertKit (now Kit)

**Pros:**

- Most advanced automation builder in the newsletter space
- Strong landing page and form builders
- Good for selling digital products alongside newsletters
- Multiple pricing tiers for different needs

**Cons:**

- $79+ for 5,000 subscribers
- Not newsletter-first (it's an email marketing tool)
- No discovery network
- Less newsletter-focused community

**Best for:** Creators who need advanced email automations (drip sequences, product launches, complex segmentation). Less ideal for pure newsletter publishing.

### Newsletter Economics: Fintech Niche

**Sponsorship rates for fintech newsletters:**

- B2B fintech newsletters command CPMs of $50-$100+ (premium niche)
- General finance newsletters: $15-$35 CPM
- Specialized stablecoin/payments audiences could command even higher given the enterprise buyer profile

**Revenue models observed in the space:**

1. **Paid subscriptions** (Substack standard): Net Interest at $30/month, Fintech Blueprint with premium tier
2. **Sponsorship/advertising**: Flat-rate sponsorship placements or CPM-based ads
3. **Newsletter-as-funnel**: This Week in Fintech using the newsletter to source deal flow for the venture fund
4. **Consulting/advisory**: Simon Taylor (Fintech Brainfood) leveraging newsletter credibility for consulting
5. **Events**: Several newsletters monetize through conferences and community events

## 5. Key Takeaways & Recommendations

### What the Best Fintech Newsletters Have in Common

1. **A specific editorial voice.** Not neutral curation -- actual opinions. Alex Johnson's "takes," Jason Mikula's "without fear or favor" investigative approach, Simon Taylor's weekend "brainfood" framing. The voice IS the product.

2. **Practitioner credibility.** Every top newsletter author has deep operational experience: Nik Milanovic (VC), Simon Taylor (11:FS + Tempo), Marc Rubinstein (hedge fund), Jason Mikula (Goldman + startups), Austin Campbell (JP Morgan + Paxos). They're not journalists covering fintech -- they're fintech people who write.

3. **Consistent structure.** Readers know what to expect. Fintech Brainfood has its sections. TWIF has its categories. Not Boring has deep dives + Friday optimism. Predictable structure reduces friction.

4. **"Slack-shareability" as the unit of growth.** The content that grows these newsletters is the content that gets forwarded in company Slack channels. This means: data-backed claims, named-company examples, and contrarian takes that spark team discussion.

5. **Multi-platform presence.** The best newsletter creators also dominate LinkedIn. The newsletter feeds LinkedIn content, and LinkedIn drives newsletter subscriptions. This flywheel is essential.

### The Stablecoin/Payments Content Gap

There is a clear gap in the market: **no dominant newsletter focuses primarily on stablecoins and payments infrastructure.** Current coverage is spread across:

- General fintech newsletters (TWIF, Fintech Brainfood) that cover stablecoins as one topic
- Crypto newsletters (Bankless) that cover stablecoins but with a crypto-native audience
- Industry trade publications (Payments Dive, PYMNTS) that cover stablecoins but in a journalistic format
- One-off reports (a16z, Castle Island, McKinsey) that go deep but infrequently

A newsletter that owns the intersection of stablecoins + payments infrastructure + enterprise adoption could capture a high-value audience of:

- Payment company executives evaluating stablecoin integration
- Bank innovation teams exploring tokenized deposits
- Fintech founders building on stablecoin rails
- VCs/investors tracking the space
- Compliance/legal teams navigating post-GENIUS Act regulation

### LinkedIn Strategy for This Space

Based on the data:

1. **Carousel/document posts** get the highest engagement (6.6% average) -- perfect for "explainer" content about stablecoin flows, payment infrastructure diagrams, and regulatory comparison charts.

2. **Data visualization posts** (Peter Walker model) are the most shareable format. A weekly stablecoin data chart would build consistent engagement.

3. **The LinkedIn algorithm in 2026** rewards expertise matching -- fintech content engaged with by fintech professionals gets amplified to more fintech professionals. Early engager quality matters more than volume.

4. **Posting frequency sweet spot:** 3-5x per week with a mix of formats (text takes, data charts, carousel explainers, newsletter cross-promotion).

5. **Comments count 2x as much as likes** in 2026's algorithm. Content that invites debate (contrarian takes, "what do you think?" questions) outperforms content that just informs.

### Platform Recommendation for a Stablecoin/Payments Newsletter

**Start on Substack** if:

- You want to leverage the existing fintech reader network
- You plan to monetize primarily through paid subscriptions
- You value simplicity and want to focus on writing

**Start on Beehiiv** if:

- You want to monetize through sponsorships/advertising (fintech CPMs are premium)
- You want built-in growth tools (referral programs, Boosts, A/B testing)
- You're thinking about this as a media business from day one
- You want to keep 100% of paid subscription revenue

**The hybrid approach** (used by several top creators): Start on Substack for discovery, build the audience, then migrate to Beehiiv or Ghost once you have enough scale to benefit from advanced monetization tools.
