## 5. Stablecoin Yield Dynamics

### Regulatory Context (Critical Development)

- Central issue: Whether stablecoin issuers should be allowed to offer yield/interest to users

### Yield-Bearing Stablecoin Market Growth

- **$9.5 billion** at start of 2025 → **$20+ billion** by early 2026
- Average yields: **~5%** (slightly above traditional money-market rates)

### Current Yield Sources (2026)

- **Treasury-linked**: Most defensible, lowest-complexity stablecoin yield
  - Tokenized T-bills / money market fund wrappers
  - Structural trend: More yield anchored to real-world short-duration rates
- **DeFi protocols**: Extra yield = compensation for operational complexity, liquidity constraints, or tail risk
- **Strategic APY offerings**: Some issuers offering 3.7-4.5% APY competitively

### DeFi Lending Yields (2026)

| Platform/Type              | Yield Range                | Notes                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Typical stablecoin lending | 3-10% APY                  | Can range 2-16% across platforms                |
| Aave                       | Variable                   | Largest decentralized lending market, $43B+ TVL |
| Compound                   | <5% APR for borrowing USDC | One of lowest borrowing rates                   |
| Spark Savings              | Up to 4.75% APY            | Zero-slippage withdrawals into USDC/USDS/DAI    |

### Aave Scale

- Surpassed **$71 trillion** in cumulative deposits
- **$43+ billion** total value locked (TVL) as of late-September 2025

### 2026 Practical Allocation Strategy
