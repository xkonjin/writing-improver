# Jin Fernando Voice Model — Structural Rules

Extracted from quantitative comparison of articles 02 (human-sounding) and 03 (human-sounding) vs 04 (flagged as AI).

## Core Diagnosis

Articles 02 and 03 read like **someone thinking**. Article 04 reads like **someone presenting their thinking**. The structural difference is PROCESS vs PRODUCT.

## The 12 Rules

### RULE 1: Transition Distribution

- 30-40% signposted ("This is where...", "The question isn't...")
- 20-25% associative ("The comparison that keeps coming to mind", "I keep seeing this pattern")
- 25-30% narrative/self-corrective ("I spent the week stress-testing", "I was wrong about...")
- 10-15% abrupt (single-sentence paragraphs that pivot direction)
- **Article 04 problem:** 60% signposted (should be 35%)

### RULE 2: Paragraph Opening Distribution

- 30-35% with data, integrated into narrative voice ("In 2024, Circle paid..." not "A study found...")
- 30-35% with narrative/opinion ("I spent the week...", "Most of it fell apart")
- 20-25% with framing ("This sounds like...", "The question isn't...")
- 10% with questions (explicit or implied)
- **Article 04 problem:** 30% conceptual framing openings (should be 20%), only 25% narrative (should be 33%)

### RULE 3: Evidence Density

- 1.5-2.3 data points per paragraph in data-heavy sections
- 50-60% of data woven into prose without study citations
- Zero consecutive study citations — always interpret between evidence points
- Data follows narrative arc — numbers appear when writer encounters them
- **Article 04 problem:** 3.1 data points per paragraph, 40% formal study citations, evidence clustering

### RULE 4: Theory Introduction Method

- 0 explicit theory-naming moments ("I'm calling this X")
- 70% embedded in narrative ("This sounds like... It isn't...")
- 20% through analogy (Berkshire comparison, electrification parallel)
- 10% as synthesis ("What AI does to skill distribution is compress it")
- Key insight appears 60-70% through section, not at start
- **Article 04 problem:** Explicit naming ("I'm calling this compression substitution"), academic citations, theory-first structure

### RULE 5: Section Length Asymmetry

- Longest sections explore most interesting/uncertain material (not counterarguments)
- Ratio of longest to shortest: 2.5-4.5:1
- Prediction sections compressed: 100-160 words max
- Solution sections minimal or absent: under 100 words
- At least one 30-50 word marked digression
- **Article 04 problem:** Longest sections are defensive (calculator panic 445w), solution section 225w

### RULE 6: Personal Voice Frequency

- 1 self-reference per 190-210 words
- 60% present-tense process ("I'm looking at", "keeps coming to mind")
- 30% past-tense investigation ("I spent the week")
- 10% uncertainty admission ("I don't know", "I can't tell yet")
- Uncertainty appears MID-SECTION as catalyst for deeper exploration, not just at end
- **Article 04 problem:** 1 per 267 words, uncertainty only at ends

### RULE 7: Paragraph Length Variation

- Shortest: 1-2 sentences, 9-21 words
- Longest: 7-9 sentences, 140-165 words
- At least 3 single-sentence paragraphs per article
- Variation is clustered: groups of short paragraphs, then sustained long ones
- Single-sentence paragraphs are pivots or punchlines

### RULE 8: Data Introduction Style

- 60% direct integration: "In 2024, Circle paid Coinbase $908 million"
- 25% following emphasis: "The number that matters" then data
- 15% parenthetical or embedded
- 0% formal study citation format ("A study by [researcher] at [institution] found...")
- Numbers first, source later or never

### RULE 9: Section Ending Types

- 60-70% end with implications ("which means...")
- 20-25% end with new questions (opening to next section)
- 10-15% end with data points (letting evidence speak)
- 0% end with summarizing what was just said
- Many endings are inconclusive — trail off into uncertainty

### RULE 10: Argument Architecture

- Non-linear exploration: at least 2 major direction changes per article
- Self-correction frequency: 1-2 explicit "I was wrong about..." moments
- Tangent ratio: 5-8% of word count in acknowledged digressions
- Solution space: under 5% of word count, or absent entirely
- Uncertainty peaks late but also drives investigation mid-article

### RULE 11: Counterargument Handling

- Embedded, not sectioned — address objections within flow
- Brief acknowledgment: 30-50 words max per objection
- Usually parenthetical or tangent-marked: "And yes, X is concerning. But..."
- Move on quickly — don't linger in defensive posture
- **Article 04 problem:** Dedicated 445-word counterargument section

### RULE 12: Transition Phrase Patterns

**High-frequency (use):**

- "This sounds like [X]. It isn't."
- "The comparison that keeps coming to mind is..."
- "I keep seeing this pattern"
- "Honestly, [qualification]"
- "Which is [probably/likely] why..."

**Low-frequency (avoid):**

- "The strongest objection to..."
- "Then there's..." (additive)
- "I'm calling this..."
- "This follows from..."
- "This distinction matters because..."

## What Makes Jin Sound Human

1. Discovery-mode transitions — reader experiences thinking-in-progress
2. Asymmetric attention — more time on interesting parts, not comprehensive coverage
3. Embedded theory — concepts emerge from evidence, not announced then defended
4. Low defensive energy — no extended counterargument sections
5. Sparse solutions — exploring problems, not positioning as expert with answers
6. Real-time process markers — present tense ("keeps coming to mind")
7. Narrative evidence — data woven into thought process, not cited academically
8. Inconclusive endings — sections trail into uncertainty or new questions

## What Makes Writing Sound AI

1. Presentation-mode structure — organized argument, not exploration
2. Uniform comprehensiveness — all objections addressed, all evidence cited
3. Announced theories — "I'm calling this..." creates academic distance
4. High defensive energy — longest sections are counterarguments
5. Solution-orientation — positions writer as having answers
6. Retrospective process markers — past tense, polished
7. Academic evidence style — study citations, institution names, clustering
8. Resolving endings — sections conclude neatly
