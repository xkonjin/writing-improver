## Structural Patterns by School

### Journalistic/Narrative (Levine, Hobart, Hayes)

- Opens with specific news/event
- Hypothetical conversation or mechanical breakdown
- Footnotes/asides for tangents
- Bouncy rhythm (short + long alternating)
- Closes with broader implication or open question

### Frameworks-First (Thompson, McKenzie)

- Introduce framework/principle
- Map current situation against it
- Identify where value concentrates
- Predict based on mechanics
- Bounce macro → specific → macro

### Deep Research/Exhaustive (Gwern, Graham, Alexander)

- 5K-20K+ words, heavy annotation
- Considers full evidence body + meta-analyses
- Acknowledges uncertainty throughout
- Conclusion emerges 60-70% through
- Multiple competing views systematically evaluated

### Aphoristic (Naval, Graham essays)

- Short clear sentences, one claim per paragraph
- Universal principles from specific examples
- Declarative, no hedging
- Repetition + refinement

### Cross-Domain Synthesis (Hobart, Hayes, Vitalik)

- Takes concept from Domain A
- Maps to Domain B
- Shows where analogy breaks
- Predicts from the connection

## Quotable Insights on Writing

**Paul Graham:** "Writing that sounds good is more likely to be right. The rhythm of good writing has to match the ideas in it."

**Naval Ravikant:** "Write one true sentence." (Hemingway technique)

**Scott Alexander:** "Style is a giant black box. Below the waterline it's the tropisms driving the bus."

**Matt Levine:** "Internet writing valorizes intertextuality — multiple lines of narrative with asides/links, not single clean narrative."

**Bret Victor:** "The most powerful way to gain insight into a system is by moving between levels of abstraction."

**Packy McCormick:** "Write at the center of the things that make you unique — distinctive passions, expertise, personality quirks."

**Byrne Hobart:** "I don't think I will ever be first to realize something important...but I can hope to be first to come up with the model that people end up using."
