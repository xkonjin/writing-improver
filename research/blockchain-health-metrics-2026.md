### Chains That Died/Became Irrelevant (2023-2026)

**Enterprise Blockchains:**

- **TradeLens** (Maersk + IBM): Shut down end of 2022 — failed to achieve commercial viability
- **Marco Polo:** Shut down early 2023
- **Contour:** Shut down late 2023

**Cryptocurrency Projects:**

- **53%+ of all tokens launched since 2021 are now inactive**
- **2025 alone:** 86% of total project failures
- **October 2025:** $19B crypto liquidation → 7.7M tokens wiped in 3 months
- **2023:** 120 projects died ($940M total financing)
- **Meme coins:** Platforms like pump.fun enabled flood of low-effort projects that quickly collapsed

**L2 Shakeout:**

- **Arkham Intelligence removed:** Blast, Linea (January 2026) — not "beneficial to crypto industry"
- **21Shares prediction:** "Most Ethereum L2s may not survive 2026" — consolidation around Base/Arbitrum/Optimism

**Zombie Chains:** Many failed projects continue operating rather than formally shutting down (unlike traditional startups)

**Key Insight:** Quality > quantity; consolidation around proven networks; low-effort tokens dying en masse
