- GPT-4 equivalent performance: $20/M tokens → $0.40/M tokens in under 2 years
- H100 cloud pricing: $8-10/hour (Q4 2024) → $2.99/hour (Q1 2026) = 64-75% decline
- Midjourney migrated from Nvidia A100/H100 to Google TPU v6e: monthly costs $2.1M → $700K (65% reduction)
- DeepSeek trained for $6M vs GPT-4's $80-100M — wiped $1 trillion from tech stocks
- Hardware: 30% annual cost decline, 40% annual energy efficiency improvement
- Software optimizations: 33x energy reduction per prompt in 12 months

### Benchmark Progression (SWE-bench Verified — real-world coding)

## Track 2: SaaS/Software Disruption Evidence

### The "SaaSpocalypse" (January-February 2026)

- S&P North American Software Index: 15% decline in January 2026 (biggest monthly drop since October 2008)
- Nasdaq Cloud Index (Feb 4, 2026): $285B wiped out in single day
- Trigger: Anthropic Claude Cowork release — fear that one AI agent replaces 50 junior employees
- Core thesis: Per-user SaaS pricing collapses if AI agents do the work

### Specific Casualties

- Chegg: $14B market cap (2021) → $191M (2024). 99% decline. CEO directly blamed ChatGPT.
- Stack Overflow: Monthly questions 200K+ (2014) → 3,862 (Dec 2025). 78% drop in one year. BUT revenue grew 40% ($89M → $125M) via enterprise pivot.
- Adobe: Down 42% over 12 months (Feb 2026)
- Salesforce: Down 36% over 12 months (Feb 2026)
- ServiceNow: Down 28% YTD (early Feb 2026)
- Jasper AI: $120M peak revenue → $35M (53% decline)

### SaaS Valuation Multiple Collapse

- Q3 2021 peak: 41.48x revenue
- 2025: ~6.1x revenue
- "Being a SaaS company no longer guarantees premium ARR multiples"

### VC Funding Shift

- ~50% of all global VC funding now flows to AI-related fields
- Top 5 AI companies raised $84B (20% of ALL VC in 2025)
- AI-native revenue: Anthropic $1B→$9B in one year. OpenAI $2B→$20B in two years.

## Track 3: Labor Market Disruption Evidence

### Entry-Level Knowledge Worker Extinction

- Entry-level developer jobs: Vanished 67% (2023-2024)
- BLS: Programmer employment fell 27.5% (2023-2025)
- BUT software developers (design-oriented): Only fell 0.3%
- UK tech graduate roles: Fell 46% in 2024; projected further 53% drop by 2026
- Big Tech entry positions: Fell ~25% from 2023-2024; new grads now ~7% of Big Tech hires
- 52% of companies eliminated entry-level positions due to AI

### Content/Creative Worker Collapse

- Writer/copy editor roles: Declined 28% in 2025 alone
- Freelance writing gigs: Declined 42% (2021-2025)
- One copywriter: $600K/year with 8 employees → less than $10K in 2025
- Graphic design: 11th fastest-declining job category per WEF (was "moderately growing")
- Photography jobs: Declined 28% in 2025

### Advertising/Marketing

- Agency headcount fell 8% in 2025
- WPP: 7,000 jobs cut. Dentsu: 3,400. Interpublic: 3,200. Omnicom: 3,000.
- Forrester: US ad agencies to lose 32,000 jobs (7.5%) to automation by 2030
- 52% of companies eliminated entry-level marketing positions due to AI

### Consulting

- McKinsey: Largest layoffs in 100-year history (~5,000 roles since 2023)
- McKinsey deployed 12,000 AI agents for document processing, drafting, coordination
- Execution firms (Accenture, Deloitte): 11-12% revenue growth
- Strategy firms (McKinsey): 5-6% growth — AI narrows the strategy premium

### Customer Service

- Klarna: AI replaced equivalent of 700 agents. $40M savings. Then RESUMED HIRING because satisfaction dropped.
- BLS: Customer service employment to decline 5.0% (~148,800 fewer positions) by 2033
- BUT: 81% of customers prefer waiting for human support vs. immediate AI

### The Bifurcated Impact

- Brynjolfsson study (5,179 agents): AI boosts novices by 34%, minimal impact on experts
- METR study (16 experienced developers): AI actually SLOWED them down by 19%
- Google RCT (~100 engineers): 21% faster completion with AI
- Multi-company RCT (5,000 devs): New/less experienced: 35-39% speedup. Seasoned: 8-16%.
- Mollick P&G study (776 professionals): Individual + AI = team of two without AI. Teams with AI 3x more likely to produce top-10% ideas.

### Code Quality Decline

- GitClear (211M changed lines): Refactoring declined 25% → <10% (2024). Copy/pasted code increased 8.3% → 12.3%.
- More code produced, lower quality. "AI is the new Stack Overflow copy-paste."

## Track 4: Historical Parallels

### The Engels' Pause (1790-1840)

- 50-60 years where GDP grew but wages stagnated
- Output per worker rose 46%, real wages rose only 12%
- Profit rate DOUBLED. Profit share of national income expanded at expense of labor and land.
- Workers only began benefiting substantially after 1840

### Handloom Weavers

- 1790s: Earned 30 shillings/week. Late 1820s: 5 shillings/week. 83% wage collapse over 30 years.
- Employment actually GREW initially: 75K (1795) → 250K (1834) before collapsing to 30K (1861)
- Competed on price until they couldn't. Growing employment with falling wages.

### Electrification Productivity Lag

- Edison's first power plant: 1882
- 1900: <5% of factories powered by electricity
- 1920: 78% of factories using electric power
- Full productivity gains: Not until 1920s — 40 years after electricity was available
- Why: Managers swapped steam for electric but kept shaft-driven factory layouts. Real gains required completely redesigning factories around "unit-drive" (individual motors per machine).
- Paul David: "The dynamo and the computer" — same pattern

### Computerization/Internet

- Solow Paradox (1987): "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics"
- 1973-1995: US productivity grew at only 1.5% annually despite massive IT investment
- Mid-1990s: Productivity rose to 2.5%. Took 15-25 years.
- Music industry: $14.6B (1999) → $6.3B (2009). 50%+ decline.
- Newspaper ad revenue: $49.4B (2005) → $25.8B (2010). 48% decline in 5 years.
- Travel agents: 124,000 (2000) → 37,200 (2021). 70% decline.
- ChatGPT: 100M users in 2 months vs personal computers 12 years for same adoption

### Carlota Perez Framework

- Installation period → Frenzy → CRASH → Synergy → Maturity
- Current position: Deep in the "Frenzy" phase
- Predicts: Financial correction, then potential "golden age" IF proper institutional reforms happen
- Whether it becomes golden age vs. lost decade depends on policy responses at the turning point

### The "Next Rung Up" Problem

- Industrial Revolution: Physical labor → cognitive labor
- Computing: Routine cognitive → creative/analytical
- AI: Cognitive → ???
- Charles I. Jones (Stanford): "Previous tech made human intelligence MORE valuable. AI potentially makes it LESS valuable."
- No obvious next category. This is structurally unprecedented.

## Track 5: Expert Predictions (The Disagreement Map)

### Extreme Optimists

- Sam Altman: "Intelligence too cheap to meter." AGI by 2025-2026. Superintelligence coming.
- Dario Amodei: Curing most diseases within 7-12 years of powerful AI. Doubling lifespan to 150 years.
- Marc Andreessen: AI will create "material utopia"
- Goldman Sachs: 7% global GDP boost, 1.5% productivity lift over 10 years

### Moderate Optimists

- Erik Brynjolfsson: Betting productivity growth averages >1.8%/year through 2029
- Paul Krugman: "I think AI is bigger than any technology we've seen before" (shifted from skeptic)
- IMF: 40% of global employment exposed, 60% in advanced economies

### Skeptics

- Daron Acemoglu (MIT): 0.05%/year productivity gain. "About 5% of economy" affected. Max 1.8% GDP over 10 years.
- Tyler Cowen: AGI is imminent AND growth will be ~1%, unnoticeable year-to-year. "Primary limitations are human factors."
- Robert Gordon: "It's not going to be a revolution." Evolutionary, not revolutionary.
- Rodney Brooks: Timelines always overestimated. GM shut Cruise after $10B investment.

### The Bear Case (Gary Marcus)

- Scaling pure LLMs will hit diminishing returns — "an era that has now been reached"
- Models are "approximations to language use rather than language understanding"
- DeepSeek vindicated the thesis: efficiency gains > raw scaling

### The 100x Prediction Gap

- Acemoglu: 0.05%/year productivity
- Goldman Sachs: 1.5%/year productivity
- ~30x disagreement between leading economists on the SAME question with the SAME data

- Adoption speed: 100M users in 2 months vs PC 12 years for same adoption
- 26.4% of workers used generative AI at work (H2 2024)
- Workers saved 5.4% of work hours

### Scaling & Cost Trajectory

- GPT-4 equivalent: $20/M tokens (2022) → $0.40/M tokens (2024)
- LLM inference costs declining ~10x/year for same performance level
- Chinchilla scaling laws showing diminishing returns on raw scaling
