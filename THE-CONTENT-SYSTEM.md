## 1. Your Niche & Positioning

### The "Category of One" Intersection

You sit at a unique intersection no one else occupies:

```
Medical Training (analytical rigor, first principles, diagnosis frameworks)
    ×
Stablecoin/Payments Expertise (Plasma insider, building in public)
    ×
Growth Marketing Practitioner (not a journalist — an operator)
    ×
Learning-in-Public Transparency (the anti-slop signal)
```

**Why this works:** There are fintech newsletters. There are stablecoin analysts. There are growth marketing writers. There is nobody who is an ex-doctor learning the stablecoin space from first principles while working at a stablecoin company and tearing down fintech growth tactics — all in public.

### The Gap in the Market

From the research: **No dominant newsletter focuses primarily on stablecoins + payments infrastructure + growth tactics.** Current coverage is fragmented across:

- General fintech newsletters (TWIF, Fintech Brainfood) covering stablecoins as one topic among many
- Crypto-native newsletters (Bankless) with crypto audiences, not payments/fintech operators
- Trade publications (Payments Dive, PYMNTS) in journalistic format, not operator format
- Infrequent deep reports (a16z, McKinsey, Castle Island) that go deep but rarely

### Target Audience (Who Shares This in Slack?)

| Segment                   | What They Need                                                 | Why They Share                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Payment company operators | Competitive intelligence, growth tactics they can steal        | Makes them look informed in #strategy channels               |
| Bank innovation teams     | Clear stablecoin explainers for internal stakeholders          | Helps them educate their org without writing it themselves   |
| Fintech founders/PMs      | Growth loop breakdowns, campaign teardowns, tactical playbooks | Immediate tactical value for their own growth                |
| VCs/investors             | Market maps, company analysis, trend signals                   | Social currency — shows they're tracking the space           |
| Compliance/legal teams    | Regulatory explainers (GENIUS Act, MiCA) in plain language     | The "I read it so you don't have to" format saves them hours |

### Positioning Statement

> For fintech operators and builders who need to understand stablecoins, payments growth, and the companies winning in this space — without the hype, jargon, or AI slop. Written by an ex-doctor learning from first principles and building in public at a stablecoin company.

### Anti-Slop Guardrails

"Slop" was Merriam-Webster's 2025 Word of the Year. Your counter-position:

- Every claim backed by a named source or data point
- Primary sources over summaries (read the SEC filing, not the tweet about it)
- Specific companies, specific numbers, specific lessons
- Acknowledge what you don't know — it builds more trust than pretending
- Your medical training is the proof: you diagnose, you don't just opine

```

**Example:** "Three possible diagnoses for why PayPal's stablecoin isn't gaining traction"

### Format 2: "I Read It So You Don't Have To"

Dense source material distilled into clear takeaways. Always link to the source.

```
THE SOURCE: [What you read — SEC filing, whitepaper, earnings call, etc.]
WHY IT MATTERS: [1-2 sentences on why anyone should care]

THE 5 KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. [Finding] — [why it matters in plain language]
2. [Finding] — [why it matters in plain language]
3. [Finding] — [why it matters in plain language]
4. [Finding] — [why it matters in plain language]
5. [Finding] — [why it matters in plain language]

## 4. Visual Style System

### Design Philosophy: The "Anti-Canva" Aesthetic

Your visuals should look like they were drawn by a smart person thinking through a problem on a whiteboard — not generated by an AI or a template library.

### Primary Tool: Excalidraw (Hand-Drawn Style)

**Why Excalidraw:**

- Free, open-source, web-based
- The hand-drawn "sketch" aesthetic is instantly recognizable as human
- Exports to high-res PNG (use 3x scale)
- Library system for reusable components
- Perfect for payment flows, growth loops, architecture diagrams

**Your Excalidraw Style Guide:**

- **Font:** Virgil (the hand-drawn default) — this IS the look
- **Color palette:** Limit to 3-4 colors maximum per diagram
  - Primary: Deep blue (#1e40af) — professional, fintech-appropriate
  - Accent: Teal (#0d9488) — differentiation, stablecoin association
  - Highlight: Amber (#d97706) — emphasis, callouts
  - Background: Off-white (#fafaf9) or transparent
- **Line style:** Hand-drawn (never "architect" mode — that looks AI-generated)
- **Arrow style:** Rounded, not sharp angles
- **Consistent framing:** Use rectangular boxes matching your target aspect ratio as artboards

### Secondary Tool: Whimsical (Clean Diagrams)

For when you need something cleaner than Excalidraw but still distinctive:

- Flowcharts for payment flows
- Mind maps for concept exploration
- Wireframe-style layouts for system architecture
- Free plan covers 3 boards

### Additional Tools

| Tool                 | Use Case                                   | Why                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **tldraw**           | Quick collaborative sketches               | Multiplayer, web-based, simpler than Excalidraw |
| **D2 (Terrastruct)** | Code-to-diagram for technical architecture | Text-based, version-controllable, Go-based      |
| **Figma**            | Polished carousel design                   | When you need pixel-perfect slides              |
| **Mermaid**          | Quick inline diagrams for newsletters      | Renders in markdown, good for flowcharts        |

### Diagram Types for Your Content

1. **Payment Flow Diagrams** — Show how money moves from A to B through stablecoin rails
2. **Growth Loop Diagrams** — Circular diagrams showing viral/referral/content loops
3. **Architecture Diagrams** — Stablecoin infrastructure stacks, API integrations
4. **Comparison Charts** — Stablecoin vs. traditional rails (cost, speed, reach)
5. **Timeline Visuals** — "How X company grew" progression
6. **Funnel Diagrams** — Conversion and adoption funnels
7. **Competitive Maps** — Market landscape positioning charts
8. **"Napkin Math" Visuals** — Quick back-of-napkin calculations with the hand-drawn style

### LinkedIn Carousel Design

- **Dimensions:** 1080×1350px (vertical, 4:5 ratio) or 1080×1080px (square)
- **Slides:** 8-12 per carousel (sweet spot for engagement)
- **File format:** PDF (maintains design integrity)
- **Structure:** Hook slide → Context → 5-7 insight slides → Summary → CTA slide
- **One idea per slide** — scannable, screenshot-friendly
- **Export from Excalidraw:** Create in 3x, export as PNG, assemble in Figma or Canva

### The "Screenshot Test"

Before publishing any visual, ask: **"If someone screenshots this single image and drops it in a Slack channel with no context, does it make sense and provide value?"**

If yes → publish. If no → simplify.

## 5. LinkedIn Playbook

### Algorithm Mechanics (2025-2026)

**How the algorithm works now:**

- **"Golden Hour":** First 60 minutes determine reach. Early engagement from your network signals quality.
- **Dwell time** is the top signal — the algorithm measures how long people stop scrolling to read your post
- **Comments count 2x more than likes** — content that invites debate wins
- **Expertise matching:** Fintech content engaged with by fintech professionals gets amplified to more fintech professionals
- **Carousel/document posts** get highest average engagement (6.6%)
- **Native content wins** — no external links in the post body (put links in comments)

**What triggers distribution:**

1. Strong hook (first 2-3 lines before "see more")
2. High dwell time (longer posts that are compelling)
3. Quality early engagers (industry-relevant people commenting)
4. Comment velocity and depth
5. Save/share actions (highest weight)

### Posting Cadence

**Frequency:** 3-5 posts per week
**Best times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9 AM in your target audience's timezone
**Content mix per week:**

| Day               | Content Type                          | Format                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Monday            | Stablecoin insight or data point      | Text post (150-300 words)           |
| Tuesday           | Growth teardown or tactical framework | Carousel (8-12 slides) or long text |
| Wednesday         | Learning-in-public / career switcher  | Personal narrative text post        |
| Thursday          | Newsletter teaser + key insight       | Text post with newsletter CTA       |
| Friday (optional) | Contrarian take or "what I got wrong" | Short provocative text post         |

### Hook Formulas That Work

Your first 2-3 lines must stop the scroll. Proven formulas:

```
DATA HOOK:
"Stablecoins processed $46 trillion last year. That's nearly 3× Visa.
But 90% of people misunderstand what that number means."

CONTRARIAN HOOK:
"Unpopular opinion: Most banks launching stablecoins will fail.
Here's why — and who will actually win."

STORY HOOK:
"6 months ago, I was an ER doctor. Today I'm explaining
stablecoin reserve requirements to bank executives. Here's what I've learned."

CURIOSITY HOOK:
"I spent 12 hours reading Circle's S-1 filing.
The 5 things that surprised me most:"

CHALLENGE HOOK:
"If you can't explain stablecoins to a 10-year-old,
you don't understand them well enough. Let me try."
```

### The "Slack-Shareable" Formula

Content gets shared in company Slacks when it has:

1. **Social currency** — makes the sharer look smart/informed
2. **Immediate tactical value** — the reader can USE this today
3. **Self-contained visuals** — one screenshot tells the whole story
4. **Named companies + specific numbers** — not abstract theory
5. **A non-obvious insight** — something they couldn't have figured out alone

**The STEPPS framework** (Jonah Berger):

- **S**ocial Currency — makes people feel like insiders
- **T**riggers — connected to things people already think about
- **E**motion — awe, surprise, or anger (not sadness)
- **P**ublic — visible to others when shared
- **P**ractical Value — useful and actionable
- **S**tories — wrapped in a narrative

### Comment Strategy

**Daily commitment:** 15-20 minutes, 5-10 substantive comments

**Who to comment on:**

- Alex Johnson (Fintech Takes)
- Simon Taylor (Fintech Brainfood)
- Austin Campbell (stablecoin policy)
- Jeremy Allaire (Circle CEO)
- Ron Shevlin (provocative banking takes)
- Peter Walker (Carta data)
- Marcel van Oost (fintech curation)
- Erin McCune (payments strategy)
- Lex Sokolin (Fintech Blueprint)
- Nik Milanovic (TWIF)

**Comment formula:**

```
1. VALIDATE — Acknowledge their point ("This is exactly right about...")
2. ADD VALUE — Share your perspective or data ("At Plasma, we've seen...")
3. OPEN A DOOR — Ask a question ("Have you looked at how this plays out in...")
```

**Rules:**

- 10+ words minimum (anything less gets zero algorithmic weight)
- Never "Great post!" — always add substance
- Engage in the Golden Hour (first 60 min after they post)
- Reply to every comment on YOUR posts

---

## 6. Newsletter Architecture

### Platform Recommendation

**Start with Substack.** Here's why for your specific situation:

- The fintech/finance category on Substack is the strongest discovery network
- Most top fintech newsletters are already on Substack — you benefit from recommendation cross-pollination
- Free to use (10% on paid subs — irrelevant until you monetize)
- Built-in notes feature for community engagement
- Simpler setup = faster to launch (don't optimize distribution before you have content)

**Migrate to Beehiiv when you hit 1,000+ subscribers** if you want:

- Ad network monetization (fintech CPMs are $50-$100+)
- Referral program tools
- A/B testing
- You keep 100% of paid sub revenue

### Newsletter Structure: "Week in Stablecoins"

**Frequency:** Weekly (Sunday evening or Monday morning send)
**Target length:** 1,200-1,800 words (5-7 minute read)

```
SUBJECT LINE: [Number] + [Specific] + [Benefit]
Examples:
- "3 stablecoin moves that will reshape payments in 2026"
- "Circle's S-1: The 5 numbers every fintech operator should know"
- "The $46T question: What stablecoin volume actually means"

STRUCTURE:

Welcome / Quick context (50 words)

  1. [Headline + 2-3 sentence analysis]
  2. [Headline + 2-3 sentence analysis]
  3. [Headline + 2-3 sentence analysis]

THE NUMBER (100 words)
  - One data point that tells a story, with context

## 7. Growth Loop Teardown Framework

Use this framework to analyze any fintech company's growth engine. This IS your repeatable content format for Pillar 2.

### The Master Template

**Step 1: Identify the Primary Growth Loop**

```
What is the core loop?
→ [User action] → [Value delivered] → [Amplification mechanism] → [New users] → repeat

Loop type:
□ Viral (user invites users) — e.g., Cash App $Cashtag
□ Content (content attracts users) — e.g., Ramp SEO
□ Paid (money acquires users) — e.g., traditional ads
□ Sales (sales team acquires users) — e.g., Stripe enterprise
□ Product-led (product sells itself) — e.g., Mercury
```

**Step 2: Apply the Racecar Framework (Lenny Rachitsky)**

```
GROWTH ENGINE: What powers ongoing growth?
  - Virality / network effects
  - Content/SEO
  - Paid acquisition
  - Sales motion

KICKSTARTS: What got them to first 1,000 users?
  - Personal network? (Stripe: Patrick personally set up merchants)
  - Community? (Mercury: YC network)
  - Stunt/PR? (Wise: "Banks Rip You Off" billboards)

TURBO BOOSTS: What campaigns accelerated growth?
  - Cash App Fridays (viral event)
  - Ramp Super Bowl ad (brand awareness)
  - Nubank invite-only exclusivity (scarcity)

LUBRICANTS: What improves conversion/retention?
  - Brand strength
  - Conversion optimization
  - Trust signals

FUEL: What resources does the engine need?
  - Capital? Content? Users? Data?
```

**Step 3: Key Metrics to Estimate**

```
CAC: How much does each new user cost?
  - Cash App: ~$20
  - Nubank: ~$15
  - Traditional banks: ~$925

LTV / Revenue per user:
  - How do they monetize?
  - What's the payback period?

Viral coefficient:
  - How many new users does each user bring?
  - Cash App: high (P2P requires receivers to sign up)
  - Wise: moderate (word-of-mouth from savings)

Retention:
  - What keeps users coming back?
  - Multi-product expansion (Revolut: FX → trading → insurance → crypto)
```

**Step 4: Network Effects & Moat**

```
Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers:
□ Scale economies — unit costs drop with scale
□ Network effects — more users = more value
□ Switching costs — painful to leave
□ Cornered resource — exclusive asset
□ Process power — organizational excellence
□ Counter-positioning — incumbents can't copy without self-harm
□ Brand — earned trust that commands premium
```

### Ready-to-Analyze Companies

| Company         | Key Loop                           | CAC                       | Why It's Interesting             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Cash App**    | Viral P2P + $Cashtag               | ~$20                      | Culture-driven virality at scale |
| **Wise**        | Transparency → WOM                 | Low (4% rev on marketing) | 80% organic growth               |
| **Nubank**      | Delight → WOM + invites            | ~$15                      | NPS 90, 80% referral             |
| **Revolut**     | Multi-product expansion            | Moderate                  | 52.5M customers, $1.4B profit    |
| **Ramp**        | Content SEO + PLG                  | Moderate                  | $0→$700M ARR in 6 years          |
| **Mercury**     | Community + VC partnerships        | Low (60% organic)         | 50% of YC companies use it       |
| **Stripe**      | Developer ecosystem                | Low                       | 7-line API changed everything    |
| **Circle/USDC** | Developer grants + regulatory moat | N/A                       | 100% YoY circulation growth      |
| **Brex**        | VC network + champagne             | High initially            | Acquired by Capital One $5.15B   |

## 9. Weekly Workflow & Systems

### The Weekly Content Machine (4 hours/week)

```
SUNDAY (60 min) — "The Intake"
├── Review week's saved articles and notes
├── Select 3-5 ideas for the week
├── Draft newsletter "One Big Thing" topic
└── Assign formats to each idea (text, carousel, teardown)

MONDAY (90 min) — "The Batch"
├── Write newsletter draft
├── Batch-draft 3-5 LinkedIn posts
├── Write hooks first, then bodies
└── Create 1 Excalidraw diagram for newsletter

TUESDAY (45 min) — "The Polish"
├── Edit and refine all drafts
├── Design carousel if needed (Figma/Excalidraw)
├── Schedule posts for the week
└── Final newsletter edit and schedule

DAILY (15-20 min) — "The Engage"
├── Reply to all comments on your posts (within 60 min of posting)
├── Leave 5-10 substantive comments on others' posts
├── Capture new ideas from conversations
└── Save interesting content for future reference

MONTHLY (2 hours) — "The Review"
├── Review analytics: what worked, what didn't
├── Identify top-performing formats and topics
├── Adjust content mix based on data
└── Set next month's content themes
```

### Idea Capture System

Use a simple system you'll actually use:

1. **Phone notes app** — capture ideas the instant they hit (article you read, conversation you had, question someone asked)
2. **Weekly review** — process notes into content ideas
3. **Content bank** — organized by pillar and format, with enough context to write from later

### The Repurposing Flow

```
Newsletter (long-form, 1,200-1,800 words)
    ↓
LinkedIn post (key insight, 150-300 words)
    ↓
Carousel (visual breakdown, 8-12 slides)
    ↓
Twitter/X thread (compressed, 5-8 tweets)
    ↓
LinkedIn comments (engagement on related posts using your insights)
```

One newsletter = 4-5 pieces of content minimum.

## 10. Distribution & Growth Tactics

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2) — Target: 50-100 subscribers

- Personal network outreach to 50 contacts
- LinkedIn announcement post about the newsletter
- Add newsletter link everywhere: LinkedIn profile, email signature, Slack bios
- Publish first 4-6 issues to build an archive
- Post 3-5x per week on LinkedIn, each with newsletter CTA
- Begin daily commenting practice

### Phase 2: Momentum (Month 3-4) — Target: 200-400 subscribers

- Cross-promote with 2-3 adjacent newsletters
- Create a lead magnet: "The Stablecoin Glossary" or "Stablecoins from First Principles" PDF
- Guest features in established newsletters
- 2-3 podcast/interview appearances (even small ones)
- LinkedIn Newsletter feature (built-in subscriber notifications)

### Phase 3: Growth (Month 5-8) — Target: 500-1,000 subscribers

- Newsletter swap partnerships (5-10 collaborations)
- Submit guest posts to fintech publications
- First viral attempt: data-driven analysis piece with original research
- Referral program (if on Beehiiv)
- Speaking at virtual events, Twitter Spaces, LinkedIn Audio
- Optional: $100-200/month in Substack/Beehiiv Boosts

### Phase 4: Scale (Month 9-12) — Target: 1,000-2,500 subscribers

- Consistent flywheel: LinkedIn → Newsletter → LinkedIn → Newsletter
- Community building (Slack/Discord for engaged readers)
- Sponsorship conversations (fintech CPMs: $50-$100+)
- Consider paid tier or premium content
- Strategic collaborations with larger newsletters

### The LinkedIn → Newsletter Funnel

```
LinkedIn Post (standalone value — NOT just a teaser)
    ↓ "I go deeper on this in my newsletter"
Newsletter Landing Page
    ↓
Welcome Email (immediate value, sets expectations)
    ↓
Weekly Newsletter
    ↓
Most engaged readers share on LinkedIn → cycle repeats
```

**Key rule:** Every LinkedIn post must deliver value on its own. The newsletter CTA promises ADDITIONAL value, not the same content behind a signup wall.

### Ethical Growth Tactics

- **Strategic commenting** (55% increase in profile views, 20% more reach on your own posts)
- **Creator communities** (10-20 creators in your niche, sharing genuinely good content)
- **Employee amplification** at Plasma (with company approval)
- **Cross-platform presence** (LinkedIn primary, Twitter secondary, newsletter core asset)
- **"Building in public" at a stablecoin company** — inherently interesting content nobody else is creating

## 12. Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (Your Differentiation)

| Creator/Newsletter               | Their Angle                       | Your Differentiation                                        |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alex Johnson (Fintech Takes)     | Sharp fintech commentary          | You: stablecoin-specific + operator POV + medical framing   |
| Simon Taylor (Fintech Brainfood) | Weekly fintech digest             | You: stablecoin-focused + learning journey + growth tactics |
| Austin Campbell                  | Stablecoin policy/regulation      | You: marketing/growth angle, not policy-only                |
| Lex Sokolin (Fintech Blueprint)  | Institutional analysis + data viz | You: more accessible, personal, operator-level              |
| TWIF (Nik Milanovic)             | Comprehensive fintech curation    | You: deeper analysis on fewer topics, not curation          |
| Bankless                         | Crypto-native audience            | You: fintech/payments audience, not crypto-native           |

### What They All Lack (Your Opening)

1. **Nobody combines stablecoins + growth marketing teardowns.** The stablecoin people write about policy. The growth people write about SaaS. You bridge both.
2. **Nobody has the career-switcher vulnerability.** They're all industry veterans. Your "learning in public" angle is fresher and more relatable.
3. **Nobody uses the medical framework.** "The Diagnosis" is a format only you can credibly pull off.
4. **The anti-slop positioning is wide open.** Most fintech content is either too surface-level or too jargon-heavy. Your "first principles" approach hits the sweet spot.
