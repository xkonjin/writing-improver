FILES CREATED:

1. first-principles-insight-generation-methodologies.md
   → 9 frameworks from academia, hedge funds, journalism, cognitive science

2. applying-methodologies-to-writing-pipeline.md
   → Tactical integration with your existing SATURATE → DISORDER → DRAFT → SCAN → EDIT pipeline
   → Enhanced multi-agent swarm design (agents mapped to Munger's 6 mental models)
   → Pre-publishing checklist
   → 4,000+ words of implementation guidance

3. first-principles-case-studies.md
   → Analysis of your Articles 02-06 showing implicit framework usage
   → Why Article 06 works (all frameworks + personal experience as anti-AI shield)
   → Why Article 04 felt AI-like despite passing metrics
   → Why Article 05 (unpublished) failed novelty test
   → 3,500+ words of diagnostic analysis

4. frameworks-quick-reference.md

KEY FINDINGS:

Methodology          | Phase in Your Pipeline      | Implementation
--------------------|----------------------------|------------------
Munger Latticework   | SATURATE                   | Assign agents to 6 mental models (psychology, economics, history, regulation, mechanism, inversion)
Falsificationism     | DISORDER                   | Explicit falsification phase: state thesis falsifiably, list breaking conditions, actively seek counter-evidence
Feynman Technique    | DRAFT                      | Mechanism clarity gate: explain each claim in 2 sentences without jargon
Novelty Testing      | SYNTHESIS                  | Data-driven (thesis collapses if data removed) vs. framework-applied (could reach by theory alone)
Surprise Validation  | STRUCTURAL SCAN            | Genuine mismatch (hippocampus triggers) vs. manufactured (announced as surprising)
Kolmogorov          | FINAL REVISION              | State core insight in <50 words or rewrite
Bridgewater Disagreement | NEW PHASE              | Devil's advocate review: strongest counter-argument documented
Renaissance Pattern  | SATURATE → IDENTIFY ANOMALIES | What patterns in data would human miss?
Academic Novelty     | SYNTHESIS                  | Remove any single data point and thesis weakens = novel

YOUR ARTICLE 06 WORKS BECAUSE:
- All frameworks present (implicit)
- Personal experience grounds mechanism (unfakeable)
- Thesis collapses if Runescape→Poloniex→BCH→Boryoku data removed
- Genuinely surprising (readers expect top-down marketing, get bottom-up narration)
- Falsifiable (documented from trader interviews)
- Can explain without jargon (narratives create coordination → floor-price protection)
- Kolmogorov-dense (specific communities, specific events, specific mechanism)

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:

1. Read: applying-methodologies-to-writing-pipeline.md (implementation guide)
2. Implement: Map agents to Munger's 6 models in next swarm run
3. Add: Falsification phase after DISORDER
4. Test: Run one new article through enhanced pipeline
5. Compare: Metrics on falsifiability, mechanism clarity, novelty vs. current pipeline
