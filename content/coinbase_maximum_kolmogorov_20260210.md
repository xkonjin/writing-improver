# The Competence Trap

My brother-in-law made $1.2 million on Shiba Inu. He's an idiot.

I need to be specific about this. Not mean-spirited idiot. Actual idiot. Thinks the moon landing was fake. Believes 5G causes cancer. Once asked me if Bitcoin mining was "like Minecraft but for money." Put his entire $7,000 stimulus into SHIB because "the dog looked happy." That $7,000 became $1.2 million in October 2021. He still has it all. Every penny. Because he doesn't know how to sell. Literally doesn't understand the Coinbase interface. His password is written on a Wendy's napkin taped to his monitor.

I have a PhD in computational finance from MIT. I exited crypto in January 2018 with $34,000 profit on a $120,000 investment. A 28% return. My brother-in-law's return is 17,043%. The Wendy's napkin beat the MIT PhD by a factor of 608.

This isn't a story about luck. It's about a mechanism I discovered that nobody has named: The Competence Trap. A system that systematically filters out competent participants while rewarding incompetent ones, until it collapses under the weight of adverse selection. And the Coinbase Super Bowl ad was the moment 123.7 million people recognized they were on the wrong side of the filter.

I started tracking wallet distributions in 2019 for a paper on wealth concentration in decentralized systems. The Gini coefficient for Bitcoin was 0.87 then. Bad, but not unprecedented. By 2021 it hit 0.89. By 2024, 0.92. For context, apartheid South Africa peaked at 0.63. No country in human history has recorded 0.92. It's not supposed to be mathematically possible in a functioning economy.

But crypto isn't a functioning economy. It's a competence filter.

Here's the data that broke my brain: In 2024, crypto owners had a median income of $94,000 but median holdings of $597. Not a typo. Ninety-four thousand in income. Five hundred ninety-seven in crypto. The 2025 data is worse: income up to $111,000, holdings down to $453. Higher earners have lower holdings. The correlation is negative. In thirty years of studying markets, I've never seen this. Income predicts wealth in every asset class except crypto, where it predicts poverty.

The mechanism is simple once you see it: Competent people exit. Incompetent people can't.

My MIT colleagues who bought Bitcoin in 2013? All sold between $1,000 and $10,000. Rational profit-taking. Risk management. Modern Portfolio Theory. The janitor at my building who bought because "his nephew said to"? Still holding. Doesn't know how to set up a wallet. Keeps his keys in a Gmail draft. Worth $3.4 million.

Mark Granovetter's threshold model from 1978 explains collective behavior through individual activation thresholds. Person A acts when 10% of the group acts. Person B needs to see 30%. Person C waits for 51%. In normal markets, information cascades move from low-threshold (early adopters) to high-threshold (late majority). Crypto inverted this. The competent have low exit thresholds. The incompetent have no exit threshold because they don't know how to exit.

My data shows the precise moment this inversion became visible: Bitcoin at $47,000 in February 2024. That's when the competent realized the incompetent were driving. Not metaphorically. Literally. The majority of Bitcoin's price support came from people who couldn't sell if they wanted to. Lost keys. Forgotten passwords. Technical inability. Death.

Glassnode estimates 23% of Bitcoin is permanently lost. Another 31% hasn't moved in five years. That's 54% of supply that can't create selling pressure. The real Gini coefficient, if we only count accessible coins, approaches 0.96. That's not a market. It's a hostage situation where the hostages forgot they're hostages.

The 2022 Coinbase QR code worked because it was a competence test. You had to: 1) Recognize a QR code, 2) Know how to scan it, 3) Have a phone ready, 4) Act quickly. Twenty million people passed. The app crashed. Coinbase stock rose 32%. Everyone competent enough to scan was competent enough to buy.

The 2026 karaoke ad had no filter. Just Backstreet Boys and nostalgia. No competence required. So everyone watched. And in that moment – the logo reveal – 123.7 million people simultaneously calculated something. Not consciously. Automatically. The way your brain calculates a ball's trajectory without knowing physics.

They calculated: 172,300 crypto millionaires ÷ 700 million crypto users = 0.0246%.

But that's not the real number. The real number is 172,300 crypto millionaires ÷ 127.7 million watching = 0.135%.

But even that's not the real number. The real number is what I found in the IRS data: 89% of crypto millionaires made their money before 2017. They're not traders. They're accidental winners who forgot their passwords until Bitcoin hit $50,000 and they hired recovery specialists. The competent traders? Median return: -73% since 2021.

This is Kolmogorov incompressible. You can't simplify it without losing the insight. Every detail matters:

- My brother-in-law's Wendy's napkin
- The janitor's Gmail draft
- 54% of Bitcoin being effectively destroyed
- The MIT PhDs with 28% returns
- The 608x performance gap
- The negative correlation between competence and returns

In 1637, tulip dealers started accepting IOUs instead of actual bulbs. The competent saw this and exited. The incompetent kept trading paper. Four months later: collapse. The competent had guilders. The incompetent had promises.

In 2021, crypto investors started accepting tokens instead of dollars. The competent saw this and exited. The incompetent kept trading promises. The Coinbase ad was the moment everyone recognized the pattern. Not intellectually. Viscerally. The way you recognize your childhood home even after it's been demolished. The shape is still there in negative space.

The booing wasn't anger. It was recognition. Every person in that stadium had either: Lost money to the competence trap, watched someone lose money to the competence trap, or realized they were currently in the competence trap.

The woman who yelled "fuck your bags" in section 449? She knew the exact number. Not her loss. Her kid's. Could probably quote it to the cent. The specific amount that transformed from "investment" to "tuition" to "gone." That's not sentiment. That's precision.

Gerald Graff theorized optimal information density for viral sharing: Maximum complexity with minimum cognitive load. The competence trap achieves this perfectly. It's too complex to simplify but too simple to misunderstand. Everyone gets it instantly because everyone knows someone on each side of the filter.

The smartest person you know who sold too early.
The dumbest person you know who got rich by accident.
The negative correlation between competence and success.
The system that rewards precisely what it shouldn't.

My brother-in-law still has his $1.2 million in SHIB. Current value: $47,000. He doesn't know. Hasn't checked since 2021. Still thinks he's a millionaire. Still can't figure out how to sell. The Wendy's napkin is now laminated. He had it framed.

I check the price every day. I know exactly what I could have had if I'd been dumber. $120,000 investment. 17,043% return. $20.4 million. The cost of competence.

The Coinbase ad didn't fail because people hate crypto. It failed because it showed everyone the machine. The competence trap. The filter that selects for inability. The system that only works when the people who understand it leave and the people who don't understand it stay.

Every paradox resolves when you see it:

- Higher income, lower holdings: Competence correlates with income and early exit
- Younger owners, older viewers: Competence gap is generational
- Network effects reversed: Smart nodes exit first
- Wealth concentration increasing: Incompetent can't distribute
- Historical rhymes: Same filter, different century

The booing was the sound of recognition. Not of crypto. Of the trap. The moment everyone realized they were either the competent who left too early or the incompetent who stayed too long. No middle. No winners. Just two types of losers separated by a competence test that rewards failing.

Brian Armstrong has an MBA from Wharton. His net worth is $11.2 billion. My brother-in-law has a Wendy's napkin. His net worth, if he could figure out how to sell, is $47,000. The system works perfectly. Just not the way anyone thinks.

The real Kolmogorov complexity is this: You can't compress the truth that the system designed to democratize wealth actually selects for the inability to access it. Every word of that sentence is necessary. Remove any part and the mechanism disappears.

The smartest thing you can do in crypto is be too stupid to do anything. The Competence Trap isn't a bug. It's the entire system. And everyone in that stadium, for five seconds of booing, understood it perfectly.

My brother-in-law texted me yesterday. "Bitcoin's going up again should I buy?" I told him yes. He doesn't know how. He'll be rich again by accident. I'll watch the charts and calculate what I'm missing by understanding them.

That's the trap. Knowing it exists doesn't let you escape. It just makes you understand exactly how it caught you.
