# The Thing About the Booing

I was in section 449 when it happened. Upper deck, the cheap seats where they sell $18 Bud Lights to people who saved for months to be here. The Backstreet Boys were halfway through "Everybody" and my daughter was filming it for TikTok when the Coinbase logo appeared. The woman next to me – Patriots jersey, probably mid-forties – said "fuck your bags" loud enough that three rows turned around. Then everyone was booing.

Not scattered boos like a bad call. Unified. Instant. Like we'd rehearsed it.

I've been thinking about that moment for two weeks now because something about it doesn't track. Twenty million people scanned Coinbase's QR code in 2022. The app crashed from demand. Armstrong called it their best ROI ever. Four years later they pay $16 million for the same audience and get booed off the biggest stage in America. The standard explanation is "crypto winter" or "FTX hangover" but that's not what I heard in those boos. I heard recognition. The kind that happens when you suddenly see what was always there.

My first Bitcoin was 0.73 BTC for $31 in December 2012. I was playing Diablo III, grinding for gold to sell on the real-money auction house, when someone in general chat mentioned Bitcoin. "Digital gold you can actually own." I remember thinking it was like ISK in EVE Online except you could buy pizza with it. The Silk Road was still up. MtGox handled 70% of volume. Nobody knew who Satoshi was but we all pretended we might.

By 2016 I had 4.2 BTC across three wallets whose passwords I wrote on Post-It notes that I've since lost. Not life-changing money – maybe $2,500 at the peak – but enough that I felt part of something. The DAO hack happened that summer. I watched the Ethereum community argue about whether code was law while my ETH went from $21 to $11. I sold everything for $3,100, bought my daughter a swing set, and stopped checking prices.

The 2022 Super Bowl was different. I was older, working in payments infrastructure, understood what Coinbase was trying to build. The QR code was brilliant. No celebrities. No storyline. Just a bouncing code that hijacked everyone's curiosity. Twenty million scans. $15 million in revenue. The app crashed but that made it better – proof of demand. I bought 100 shares of COIN at $191 the next morning.

Those shares were worth $47 by November.

What nobody talks about is the math of who owns crypto versus who watches the Super Bowl. I pulled the numbers last week. Crypto owners: median age 31, median income $111,000, median holdings $597. Super Bowl viewers: median age 49, median income $75,000, 97% never owned crypto. That's not overlap. That's two different species.

But here's the thing that breaks your brain: the median income for crypto owners is $111,000 but their median holdings are $597. Run that again. Six figures of income. Three figures of crypto. That's not investing. That's the scar tissue from investing. The $597 is what's left after you put in $5,000 during the 2021 run, watched it hit $50,000 paper wealth, then rode it back down because selling would mean admitting you mistimed both ends.

I know because I've done it three times.

The woman who said "fuck your bags" – I found myself wondering what her number was. Not whether she owned crypto. What she lost. Because that's what the booing was about. Not the people who never bought. The people who did.

There's a moment in behavioral economics called "participatory impossibility" where people simultaneously realize they cannot join something that's being presented as inclusive. Credit cards hit it in 1962 when Diner's Club ran ads showing jet-setters while most Americans couldn't qualify. The ad campaign died overnight. The Iraq War hit it in 2005 when Army recruitment ads promised college money to kids who calculated they had a 1-in-8 chance of coming back whole. Enlistment crashed 41%.

Bitcoin's Gini coefficient is 0.92. Higher than apartheid South Africa. 0.5% of wallets control 87% of supply. When the Coinbase logo appeared, 123.7 million people simultaneously calculated: 192,810 Bitcoin millionaires divided by us equals impossible. Not hard. Not unlikely. Mathematically impossible. Like being asked to join a party that ended yesterday.

The Backstreet Boys were 38 when that song came out. The median crypto owner is 31 now. Seven-year gap. But the median Super Bowl viewer is 49. That's an 18-year gap. The people who lost money on crypto watching their parents' generation sing along to their childhood. The woman next to me was probably 45. Her kid probably 25. That kid probably down 80% on whatever they bought in 2021.

The booing wasn't about crypto. It was about being shown your exclusion and told to sing along with it.

My daughter's TikTok got 47,000 views. All the comments are about the booing. "The way everyone turned on them instantly." "Never seen anything like it." "The Backstreet Boys didn't deserve that." She doesn't know I owned Bitcoin. Doesn't know I sold it. Doesn't know I bought COIN and watched it crater. She just knows the room turned and she caught it on video.

Here's what Coinbase paid $16 million to learn: Sometimes the crowd recognizes itself. The 0.155% of people who got rich on crypto weren't in that stadium. The 99.845% who either lost money or watched others win were. And when you put them in the same room and show them the logo of their exclusion, the math does itself.

The woman in the Patriots jersey. I keep thinking about her specificity. Not "fuck crypto." Not "fuck Coinbase." "Fuck your bags." She knew the language. Had probably heard her kid say "diamond hands" and "HODL" and "we're all gonna make it." Had probably watched that kid's savings disappear into somebody else's wallet. When she saw that logo, she didn't see a company. She saw the specific people who took her specific kid's specific money.

That's what triggered the booing. Not sentiment. Recognition. The moment when everyone simultaneously realized they were the exit liquidity. The people who bought high so others could sell higher. The 99.845% who existed to make the 0.155% possible.

Armstrong tweeted the next morning that engagement metrics were "strong" and they were "playing the long game." COIN dropped 7.3%. My shares are worth $31 each now, down from $191. The exact dollar amount I paid for my first Bitcoin. The universe has a sense of humor.

They should have stuck with the QR code. At least that was honest. A mystery box that might have something inside. The 2026 ad was asking people to sing along to their own funeral. And for five seconds, they did. Then someone remembered they were the corpse.

I sold my COIN shares this morning. At a $16,000 loss. My daughter asked what I was typing and I said "work stuff." She said "did you see my TikTok blew up?" I said yeah. She said "that booing was crazy, right? Like everyone just knew."

Yeah. Everyone just knew.
