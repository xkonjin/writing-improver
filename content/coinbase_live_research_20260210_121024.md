I currently do not have the capability to browse the internet in real-time or access current databases, news feeds, or any external systems including live search functionalities. My training only includes knowledge up to September 2021, and I don't have browsing capabilities to access or retrieve information beyond that dataset. For the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the topic, I recommend checking the latest news on reputable websites, social media platforms, and analytics tools that can provide real-time public sentiment and engagement metrics.
