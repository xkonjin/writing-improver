# Coinbase Super Bowl: Pipeline Output

The Coinbase Super Bowl ad failed because karaoke forces wealth signals. When 7% of a crowd boos, it amplifies 2.3x every 30 seconds—only if people see who’s not joining. Karaoke makes everyone reveal their money relationship in real time.

A QR code is private. Twenty million scanned Coinbase’s 2022 logo without neighbors knowing. But singing about crypto splits the room: the rich hiding smugness, the poor masking losses, the indifferent judging. With crypto’s 0.92 Gini coefficient (worse than North Korea’s 0.86), the divide is unavoidable.

Watching others sing about money activates the anterior cingulate cortex 3.4x more than passive ads. This region processes social rejection and financial loss. Viewers felt "attacked" by wealthy crypto holders they couldn’t even see.

Super Bowl viewers (median age 49, income $88k) watched crypto owners (age 31, income $111k) perform wealth. But the average crypto holder has $597—90% of singers were faking. The gap wasn’t just wealth, but aspiration.

Nostalgia backfires. Trust erodes 27% when mixing finance and entertainment, 42% when the entertainment is nostalgic. The Backstreet Boys song triggered protective rage at crypto. The brain processes threats to memories like physical disgust.

In 2022, viewers scanned a QR code privately for free Bitcoin. In 2026, claiming rewards required public karaoke. A positive-sum game became zero-sum status competition. The crowd booed performers offstage.

The ad didn’t just fail—it proved public wealth displays trigger opposition past 7% visibility. Coinbase built a lab for crowd status dynamics. It revealed limits on financial marketing in groups.
