## The Ultimate Shock: Perfect System Design

**Crypto achieves the impossible:**

- Creates real value from collective agreement that nothing has value
- Maintains "decentralization" narrative while concentrating control
- Uses biological drives to override economic rationality
- Builds periodic destruction into the core mechanism
- Converts electricity into pure abstraction efficiently

**Result:** Humanity's first successful weaponization of nihilism for profit.
