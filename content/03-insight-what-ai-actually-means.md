# The Two Timescales

## Insight V2

---

Goldman Sachs says AI will boost global GDP by 7% over the next decade. Daron Acemoglu, the 2024 Nobel laureate in economics, says closer to 1.1%. Same question, same available data, 6x apart.

I've been going back and forth on who's right. And I think the answer is both of them, but about different things.

### The fast clock

The AI capability timescale is measured in months. In September 2024, the best score on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark where AI autonomously finds and fixes real bugs in production codebases like Django and scikit-learn, was 42%. By November 2025, Claude Opus 4.5 hit 80.9%. Fourteen months, nearly doubled.

The money follows. Anthropic went from $1 billion to $9 billion in revenue in twelve months. Cursor went from $1 million to over $500 million in two years. GitHub Copilot crossed $2 billion ARR with 90% of the Fortune 100 paying for it. A junior developer costs roughly $72,000 a year. The AI coding tools that increasingly do their work cost about $240.

And the curve is steepening, because AI is now improving AI. OpenAI said GPT-5.3-Codex was "instrumental in creating itself." Algorithmic efficiency in AI training improved 22,000x between 2012 and 2023. Microsoft says a third of their code is now AI-generated. Google says roughly a quarter. No previous technology actively accelerated the process of building more of itself.

### The slow clock

Thomas Edison opened the Pearl Street Power Station in 1882. By 1900, less than 5% of American factories used electricity. By 1920, 78% did. But the productivity gains everyone expected didn't appear until the 1920s. Forty years after the technology existed.

Paul David, the economic historian, figured out why. Factory owners did the obvious thing: ripped out the steam engine, dropped in an electric motor. Same layout, same shaft-and-belt drive system, same work organization. Slightly cheaper power. No productivity revolution.

The revolution came a generation later, when managers who'd grown up with electricity designed factories from scratch around individual electric motors per machine. Single-story buildings instead of multi-story. Open floor plans following material flow. Each workstation independently powered. The factories looked completely different. The gains were enormous.

This is where we are with AI. Companies are plugging ChatGPT into customer service, adding Copilot to their IDE, putting Claude in Slack. MIT reported in 2025 that 95% of generative AI pilots fail. Not because the technology doesn't work. Because the organizations haven't been redesigned around it.

Klarna replaced the equivalent of 700 customer service agents with AI in early 2024. Projected $40 million in savings. Then started hiring humans again because customer satisfaction dropped. The technology worked fine. The organization hadn't adapted to what the technology actually needed from it.

Tyler Cowen put it well: "The primary limitations to progress are increasingly human factors, not computational power or intelligence." AGI might arrive next year. The org chart at most Fortune 500 companies will look the same in 2030.

### Where the weavers come in

This is the section I keep going back to.

During the Industrial Revolution, handloom weavers in Britain earned around 30 shillings per week in the 1790s. By the late 1820s, they earned 5 shillings. An 83% wage collapse over thirty years. But here's the part most people leave out: employment among weavers actually _grew_ during most of this period. From 75,000 in 1795 to 250,000 in 1834. The number of weavers peaked decades after their wages collapsed. They competed on price, accepting worse and worse terms, until the power loom made even cheap human labor uneconomic.

Growing employment with falling wages. I keep seeing this pattern.

Entry-level developer jobs vanished 67% between 2023 and 2024. BLS data shows programmer employment fell 27.5% over two years. But design-oriented software developer roles barely moved, down 0.3%. Freelance writing gigs declined 42% from 2021 to 2025. One copywriter went from $600,000 a year with eight employees to less than $10,000 in 2025. KPMG's graduate intake dropped 29%. Deloitte's dropped 18%. Photography jobs declined 28% in 2025 alone.

Many of these people are still working. They're working for less.

Erik Brynjolfsson ran one of the largest empirical studies on this. 5,179 customer service agents, staggered rollout of an AI assistant, randomized control. Novice workers improved 34%. Experienced workers barely moved. GitClear analyzed 211 million lines of changed code and found the downstream effect: refactoring declined from 25% to under 10%, while copy-pasted code increased from 8.3% to 12.3%. More output, but shoddier output.

What AI does to a skill distribution is compress it. Pulls novices toward expert-level performance while doing little for the experts themselves. Which means the years of deliberate practice that made experts expert are suddenly worth less. And the entry-level positions where people used to build those years of experience? Those are the jobs disappearing fastest.

### The new Engels' Pause

Between 1790 and 1840, British GDP per worker rose approximately 46%. Real wages rose 12%. Economic historians call this the Engels' Pause. It lasted fifty to sixty years. The profit rate doubled. GDP grew. Workers didn't benefit.

Workers eventually did benefit, starting around 1840. But "eventually" meant half a century. And the improvement came from institutional adaptation, not the technology itself. Factory Acts. Labor unions. Public education. Expanding suffrage. The whole apparatus of reform that reorganized society around industrial reality.

I think we're entering the early stage of a new version of this.

On January 30, 2026, the S&P North American Software Index dropped 15% in a single month, the biggest decline since October 2008. By February 4, the Nasdaq Cloud Index had lost $285 billion. Adobe down 42% over twelve months. Salesforce down 36%. About 50% of all global venture capital now flows to AI companies. The top five raised $84 billion in 2025 alone.

Meanwhile, 52% of companies have eliminated entry-level positions due to AI. McKinsey executed its largest layoffs in 100 years while simultaneously deploying 12,000 AI agents internally. Capital is moving at the speed of the fast clock. Labor markets are adjusting at the speed of the slow clock.

Q3 2025 US labor productivity hit 4.9%, well above the long-run average. I'll be honest, I can't tell yet whether this is a real inflection or just a good quarter. The Solow Paradox with computers lasted from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s. "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." When it finally resolved, it wasn't because computers got better. It was because organizations that had grown up with computers redesigned their processes around them.

We're not there yet with AI.

### The missing rung

Every previous technology revolution disrupted one type of work while creating demand for a higher type. The Industrial Revolution automated physical labor and created demand for cognitive labor. Computerization automated routine cognitive tasks and created demand for creative and analytical work. Brutal for the people in the automated category, but there was always a next rung on the ladder.

Charles I. Jones at Stanford identified what's different this time: "Previous technological advances replaced humans in physical tasks or a narrow set of cognitive tasks, making human intelligence more valuable. AI could potentially perform every task a human can do but more cheaply."

The candidates people mention for the next rung (judgment, taste, emotional intelligence, accountability) are real advantages. For now. But the CEO exposure score, a measure of how much of a CEO's cognitive work AI can theoretically handle, already exceeds 60%. That number was projected to reach 25% by 2032. And with AI systems helping build better AI systems, the capability frontier isn't holding still.

I don't know what the next rung is. For the first time in 200 years, the ladder doesn't have an obvious next step. If someone has a convincing answer, I haven't come across it yet.

### Two predictions

Here are two things I'd actually bet on.

First: by September 2027, Fortune 500 undergraduate hiring will have dropped more than 50% from 2023 levels. The pattern is already visible at Big Four accounting firms and top consulting houses. Check it against NACE hiring data and LinkedIn's annual report.

Second: Acemoglu will look more accurate than Goldman through 2030. The technology works. Institutions take decades to reorganize around it. Productivity numbers will disappoint relative to the hype. The distributional effects won't.

The technology arrives in months. The institutional reorganization takes decades. The Factory Acts came in 1833, about fifty years into the Industrial Revolution. We're roughly three years into ours, and nobody's written the equivalent yet.
