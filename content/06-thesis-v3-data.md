# The Settlers Lobbied for Terraforming

Tether has roughly 300 employees. In 2024, it made $13 billion in profit — within 10% of Goldman Sachs, which has 49,000. That's $43 million per employee versus $292,000. A 147x difference. If valued like a bank at 10x earnings, Tether would be worth $130 billion, which would make it the second most valuable financial institution in America.

I keep coming back to this number because it answers the question Matt Huang posed in September 2023. His "Casino on Mars" argued crypto speculation bootstraps civilization the way the Gold Rush built San Francisco. Three years later: stablecoin transaction volume hit $46 trillion in 2025 — exceeding Visa. A company with 300 people holds more US Treasuries than South Korea. Stripe built on it. BlackRock tokenized Treasuries with it. The US Treasury Department wants more of it.

The question everyone's been asking — did the casino build real infrastructure? — is settled. $297 billion in stablecoins. BNY Mellon running custody. BlackRock operating a fund on Ethereum using the ERC-20 standard that was designed for memecoins. SpaceX routing Starlink payments through Bridge to hedge foreign exchange exposure with stablecoins.

It did.

## What the Money Did

The 2021 vintage of crypto VC — funds that deployed at peak euphoria — is running at 0.2% median IRR. Not 20%. Zero-point-two. The 2023 vintage, deployed after the crash, is at 24.5% at the 90th percentile. This isn't one fund's bad luck. It's the entire asset class. The $33 billion deployed at the peak built the infrastructure. The funds deploying now get to buy it cheaper.

And the deployment phase arrived. Crypto M&A hit $8.6 billion in 2025 — four times the prior year. Coinbase bought Deribit for $2.9 billion. Stripe bought Bridge for $1.1 billion. Ripple bought Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Eleven crypto companies went public, raising $14.6 billion combined. Circle opened at $31, touched $299, and settled at $57 — the volatility tells you the market doesn't know how to price these companies yet, which means the pricing discovery is early. The exit window opened, but through acquisitions and IPOs, not token launches.

That shift is structural.

Then there's the category rotation. Gaming and NFTs went from a significant share of crypto VC in 2022 to under 5% by H1 2025. Infrastructure and DeFi absorbed 75%. Stablecoin-specific funding went from $84 million in 2024 to $537 million. But here's what I didn't expect: 40 cents of every crypto VC dollar in 2025 went to companies also building AI, up from 18 cents the year before. The money isn't leaving crypto. It's following the settlement layer into adjacent markets — cross-border payments, agent infrastructure, treasury management.

And it's not just stablecoins. Uniswap processed $1 trillion in swap volume in 2025 — 915 million trades. Aave holds $43 billion in deposits and generated $885 million in protocol fees. Helium Mobile, a DePIN telecom network on Solana, went from 200,000 users to 2 million in a year. These aren't speculative projects. They're businesses with revenue. Solana itself processed over $1 trillion in stablecoin volume — toly's prediction of $1 trillion in stablecoin supply by end of 2026 doesn't sound crazy when his own chain already settles that in volume.

Coinbase's own numbers tell the same story. In 2020, 96% of revenue came from trading fees. By 2025, subscription and services hit 41% — $2.9 billion annually. The largest driver is yield on USDC reserves. They're a bank that happens to run an exchange. Base, their L2, did 299 million transactions a month and $82.6 million in revenue. Jesse Pollak said it plainly: "We don't want to re-create the old systems with new tech." Q3 2025 revenue was $1.87 billion, up 55% year-over-year. They joined the S&P 500 in May.

So when I hear that crypto venture failed, I think about what actually happened. The speculation capital ($33 billion at peak in 2022) built infrastructure that is now being monetized through different channels — M&A, IPOs, subscription revenue, Treasury yield — than the ones the speculators expected. The casino didn't fail. The house just changed ownership.

## Where It Matters Most

When the GENIUS Act passed — 68-30 in the Senate, signed July 2025 — it put the new order into law. Three tiers of stablecoin issuers: bank subsidiaries (unlimited), OCC-chartered nonbanks, and state-chartered issuers capped at $10 billion. Interest payments to holders prohibited. Yield goes to the issuer.

My first reading was doom — banks with 80 million customers just got permission to issue zero-cost deposits. But five OCC conditional charters went to crypto-native firms: BitGo, Circle, Fidelity Digital Assets, Paxos, Ripple. The compliance moat cuts both ways. And the domestic debate misses where the real usage is.

Stablecoin flows represent 6.7% of GDP in Africa and the Middle East. In North America, 0.4%. B2B stablecoin payments went from under $100 million a month in early 2023 to $6 billion a month by mid-2025. Argentina's crypto ownership hit 29.4%. Nigeria leads per capita globally. Moneygram launched stablecoin remittance in Colombia. A 1% reduction in remittance fees saves $23 billion per year globally. Tether survives the bank invasion specifically because it serves markets banks won't — Lagos, Istanbul, Buenos Aires. As Efayomi Carr put it: "In 2026, stablecoins will increasingly function as primary financial accounts in emerging markets."

Not a moat Wall Street can cross.

## Mars Gets an Atmosphere

In Kim Stanley Robinson's _Red Mars_, the colony splits between those who want Mars wild and those who want it habitable. The Greens win. Mars gets an atmosphere. The transnational corporations arrive with existing infrastructure and existing customers.

Huang's essay told the first half of this story. The casino built civilization. What happened next depends on which numbers you look at.

From one angle, absorption. Huang moved from writing about settlers to running a stablecoin payments company. Coinbase joined the S&P 500 and added stock trading, prediction markets, commodities. Circle's IPO was underwritten by the banks it will eventually compete with. Five crypto-native firms got OCC bank charters. The settlers who survived did it by becoming Earth companies.

But Robinson didn't account for one thing. AI agents need wallets. Visa launched a Trusted Agent Protocol. PayPal and OpenAI built Agent Checkout. The x402 protocol processed 15 million transactions. Non-human identities outnumber human employees 96-to-1 in finance — and they're unbanked. If autonomous agents become significant economic actors, crypto's programmable settlement is the only infrastructure that exists for them.

The question I can't resolve is whether the technology wins by disappearing. TCP/IP won by becoming invisible. Nobody thinks about it when they open a browser. But TCP/IP's creators captured none of the economic value. If stablecoins become invisible settlement infrastructure, is that a triumph or a tragedy? Robinson's settlers didn't own Mars. Their legacy is that Mars has an atmosphere.

Patrick Collison called stablecoins "room-temperature superconductors for financial services." Sam Broner at a16z put it more directly: "Stablecoins are already the best way to build a global fintech because they're fast, nearly free, and easily programmable." Nic Carter thinks we're a year or two from intermediaries showing your deposits as generic "dollars" rather than USDC or USDT — stablecoins disappearing into the plumbing the way TCP/IP disappeared into the browser.

Whether the people who built this keep ownership is a separate question from whether they built something that matters. I think the data is clear on the second part. The first is genuinely open — and I'm more optimistic about it than I was six months ago.

**Who wins:** Companies with compliance infrastructure and distribution — crypto-native or traditional. Tether in markets banks can't serve. Stablecoin issuers as mandatory Treasury demand ($1T in circulation = $1T in T-bill purchases). AI-crypto convergence builders. The 2023-vintage funds that bought the crash.

**Who's exposed:** 2021-vintage portfolios broadly (0.2% median IRR). Projects whose moat was technical understanding rather than distribution. Gaming and NFT plays riding the previous cycle.

**Prediction:** By Q4 2027, at least three top-ten US banks issue stablecoins through GENIUS Act subsidiaries, combined issuance exceeding $50 billion. Stablecoin annual transaction volume reaches $100 trillion. At least one AI agent payment protocol exceeds $1 billion in monthly volume.

**What proves me wrong:** Banks find stablecoin compliance uneconomical. DeFi composability creates a moat institutional products can't replicate. The CLARITY Act yield war kills the regulatory framework. AI agent payments remain vaporware — and the "next chapter" is a footnote. Or: the developing-world corridor proves worth more than the institutional market, and Tether becomes the most important financial company of the decade rather than a transitional player.
