# X Posts: The Stablecoin Issuer Stack

---

## THREAD

### Tweet 1:

Bridge made stablecoin issuance an API call. Stripe paid $1B+ for them. So the interesting question shifts — minting a token is solved. What isn't solved: getting bank accounts in the jurisdictions you need, clearing the GENIUS Act licensing queue, and building payment routing. Those are years-long problems.

### Tweet 2:

Circle's S-1 showed their reserve setup: 75% Treasuries (BlackRock), 25% cash at BNY Mellon/JPMorgan/Goldman. Monthly attestation under GENIUS Act. This is the part every analyst covers and the part any funded team replicates in a quarter. It's not what differentiates Circle.

### Tweet 3:

What differentiates Circle: banking relationships in multiple jurisdictions, CCTP cross-chain protocol, near-instant minting with same-day fiat redemption (3 PM ET cutoff), and regulatory approvals that took years.

If your stablecoin issuer takes 2 business days to redeem, you've built ACH with more counterparty risk.

### Tweet 4:

The part of the stack I keep underestimating: banking access. You need banks that will receive and send fiat in every market you serve. US banking doesn't help your Singapore customers. EU EMI doesn't give ACH access.

The list of banks willing to handle stablecoin flows is short. Those banks know it.

### Tweet 5:

GENIUS Act (effective Jan 2027): stablecoin issuers must be "permitted payment stablecoin issuers." Bank charter, OCC nonbank approval, or qualifying state license. 2-3 year process.

Circle and Paxos already have this. New stablecoin launches I've been tracking — when you ask about licensing timelines, the conversations get less specific.

### Tweet 6:

The layer that gets almost zero coverage: orchestration. $50K cross-border payment — which stablecoin, which chain, which pool, which off-ramp, what FX rate, what fallback.

Good routing = 50bps. No routing = 5%. Same payment. This barely exists as a named product category yet.

## STANDALONE TWEETS

### A:

Bridge made stablecoin issuance an API call. So the question everyone evaluating this space should be asking shifted — not "can they mint a token" but "which banks process their fiat flows, what licenses do they hold, and how do they route payments across jurisdictions."

The second set of questions gets quiet answers from most new entrants.

### B:

At single-digit bips on stablecoin transaction fees, a chain needs $200B+ in annual volume for meaningful revenue. Switching costs between chains are near-zero. A payment processor migrates in a weekend.

Volume dashboards measure who's spending on incentives. They don't measure who has a business.

### C:

Western Union has 400,000 physical agent locations. If they become the primary cash-to-stablecoin on-ramp, that's a harder position to replicate than any new token launch. The stablecoin stack needs feet on the ground, not just code on chain.

### D:

Something I keep noticing talking to payments companies about stablecoins: everyone asks about the technology first. Which chain, what smart contracts, how do reserves work.

Those are the solved parts. The unsolved parts are banking access, regulatory licensing, and payment routing. Different skill sets entirely.

## QUOTE TWEETS

### On a new stablecoin launch:

The token is the solved part. What I'd want to know: which banks process their fiat flows, what licenses they hold, and how they route payments across multiple chains and off-ramps. Most new launches can answer the first question on their FAQ. The last three take years.

### On stablecoin volume numbers:

Volume at near-zero fees with near-zero switching costs measures who's spending on incentives. The number I'd track instead: what products are built on the rails that create actual switching costs. Orchestration, compliance tooling, merchant settlement.

### On GENIUS Act / regulation:

The underappreciated part of GENIUS Act: it creates a licensing queue that takes 2-3 years. Companies that already have banking relationships and regulatory approvals got them before the queue formed. That's a structural advantage that more funding or better engineering doesn't close.
