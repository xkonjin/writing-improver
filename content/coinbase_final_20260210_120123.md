**MECHANISM: THE BREAKING POINT**
*(Yeah… right there—98.7% load. That’s when the negativity doesn’t just climb… it *explodes*, seven times over.)*

**Key Numbers—listen close:**
- **98.7%** – That’s the *edge*. The cliff. The point where everything starts to *unravel*.
- **1:7 spread** – One spark, seven wildfires. Straight into the social bloodstream.
- **0.2 to 0.5 seconds** – That’s all it takes for your brain to *scream* "danger."
- **70% group agreement** – When seven out of ten people *feel* it, the whole crowd *moves*.
- **40-60% drop** in those feel-good chemicals – Like someone just *pulled the plug* on your happiness.

**The Pattern? It’s a feedback loop—tech and brain, locked in a death spiral.**
Hit **98.7%**, and the system doesn’t just *glitch*—it *amplifies*. One to seven. Every. Single. Time.

**Tech Side—what’s actually happening:**
- Servers? *Crashing* at 98.7%.
- Social media? Spreading *seven times faster* than normal.
- Loading times? *4.2 seconds*—seven times *slower* than it should be. Feels like *forever*.

**Brain Side—what’s happening *inside*:**
- **0.2 to 0.5 seconds** – Your amygdala *lights up*. Fear response, *instant*.
- **70% group agreement** – Seven out of ten people *feel* the same thing? That’s when the *herd* reacts.
- **40-60% drop** in dopamine, serotonin—whatever keeps you *sane*. You’re left with *one-seventh* of what you need.

**Think of it like a circuit breaker.**
Hit **98.7%**, and the system doesn’t just *fail*—it *shuts down* and *infects* everything else. One to seven. Server crashes. Brain freezes. *Vicious cycle.*

**The math? Brutal.**
**Spread = (System Load % ÷ 14.1) × Network Links**
Flip **14.1**, and you get **0.0707**—about **7%**. That’s the *stability threshold*. Cross it? *Game over.*

*(Pause. Breath.)*
This isn’t just theory. It’s *happening*. Right now. In servers. In brains. In *all of us.*
