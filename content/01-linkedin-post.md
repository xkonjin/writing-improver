Working in stablecoin infrastructure, the thing that keeps coming up in conversations with payments companies: everyone asks about the technology. Which chain, what smart contracts, how do reserves work.

Those are the straightforward parts. Bridge made issuance an API call. Stripe paid $1B+ for them. Any funded team builds token minting and reserve management in a quarter. Circle's S-1 showed their reserve setup: 75% Treasuries (BlackRock), 25% cash at BNY Mellon/JPMorgan/Goldman. Nothing proprietary there.

The hard questions are different.

𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀: You need banks that will receive and send fiat in every jurisdiction you serve. US banking doesn't help Singapore customers. EU EMI doesn't give ACH access. The list of banks willing to handle stablecoin flows is shorter than people think, and those banks set the terms.

𝗟𝗶𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴: GENIUS Act (effective Jan 2027) requires stablecoin issuers to be "permitted payment stablecoin issuers." Bank charter, OCC nonbank approval, or qualifying state license. 2-3 year queue. Circle and Paxos already cleared it.

𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: $50K cross-border payment — which stablecoin, which chain, which pool, which off-ramp, what FX rate. Good routing = 50bps. No routing = 5%. Same payment. This barely exists as a product category yet.

New stablecoin launches I've been tracking — when you ask about banking partners or licensing timelines, the conversations get less specific. The token is the part they have figured out.

What differentiates Circle isn't their reserves. It's their banking relationships, their CCTP cross-chain protocol, their regulatory approvals — things that took years, not quarters.

Wrote a longer breakdown with specific companies and economics at each layer — link in comments.
