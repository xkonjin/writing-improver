# The Settlers Lobbied for Terraforming

I got my screen name from a game. Most of us did. You picked a handle at 14 playing Runescape, kept it through forum accounts, IRC channels, Telegram groups, CT. The pipeline made sense if you lived it — Grand Exchange taught you price discovery, world 2 Varrock taught you information asymmetry, and the first time someone offered to trim your rune armor for free taught you more about trust assumptions than any whitepaper ever would. Then you found Bitcoin and it clicked. Digital scarcity. Pseudonymous value transfer. You'd been doing it for years.

In 2016 we were on Poloniex watching ETH go from a dollar to ten, refreshing a page that crashed every time something pumped. The trollbox — a live chat embedded right on the exchange — was 200 people screaming about Monero at 3am. Someone posted "WOW MONERO WOW DASH WOW UNLIMITED COCAINE" and caught a one-day ban. The site went down during the ETC listing after the DAO hack. Frozen withdrawals, margin calls liquidating into empty order books, Stellar bags you never meant to hold. They shut the trollbox down in June 2017 and reassigned the moderators to handle support tickets because the exchange was overwhelmed. It was a mess. It was ours.

Then there were the wars. BCH forked in August 2017. Roger Ver and Jihan Wu on one side, Core developers on the other, r/bitcoin banning anyone who mentioned bigger blocks while r/btc became a parallel universe. Theymos said "if 90% of users are unhappy, they should all leave." Then Craig Wright showed up claiming to be Satoshi — BBC flew a reporter in, he was supposed to prove it by moving coins from Satoshi's address. Nothing happened. Gavin Andresen said he'd been "bamboozled." BSV forked from BCH a year later, Calvin Ayre declared a hash war, and that ended too. The blocksize wars felt existential at the time and produced nothing but two zombie forks and a lot of people who don't talk to each other anymore.

And then Boryoku Dragonz sold out in under three minutes. 1,111 dragons on Solana, November 2021. A legendary dragon auctioned for 1,111 SOL — a quarter million dollars for a JPEG. Floor today is 1.38 SOL. I'm not making fun of it. I had my own bags. Everyone did. That was the peak — DeFi summer food tokens (YAM imploded in 36 hours after a rebase bug, Chef Nomi dumped $14 million of SUSHI and apologized later), Bored Apes going from 0.08 ETH to 152 ETH, Larry David filming a Super Bowl ad for FTX then saying "like an idiot, I did it" after FTX collapsed with $8 billion of customer money.

And now Tether has roughly 300 employees. In 2024, it made $13 billion in profit — within 10% of Goldman Sachs, which has 49,000. That's $43 million per employee versus $292,000. A 147x difference.

I keep coming back to this number because it answers the question Matt Huang posed in September 2023. His "Casino on Mars" argued crypto speculation bootstraps civilization the way the Gold Rush built San Francisco. Three years later: stablecoin transaction volume hit $46 trillion in 2025 — exceeding Visa. A company with 300 people holds more US Treasuries than South Korea. Stripe built on it. BlackRock tokenized Treasuries with it. The US Treasury Department wants more of it.

Did the casino build real infrastructure? $297 billion in stablecoins. BNY Mellon running custody. BlackRock operating a fund on Ethereum using the ERC-20 standard that was designed for memecoins. SpaceX routing Starlink payments through Bridge to hedge foreign exchange exposure with stablecoins.

It did.

## What the Money Did

The 2021 vintage of crypto VC — funds that deployed at peak euphoria, when we were trading dragon JPEGs — is running at 0.2% median IRR. Not 20%. Zero-point-two. The 2023 vintage, deployed after the crash, is at 24.5% at the 90th percentile. This isn't one fund's bad luck. It's the entire asset class. The $33 billion deployed at the peak built the infrastructure. The funds deploying now get to buy it cheaper.

And the deployment phase arrived. Crypto M&A hit $8.6 billion in 2025 — four times the prior year. Coinbase bought Deribit for $2.9 billion. Stripe bought Bridge for $1.1 billion. Ripple bought Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Eleven crypto companies went public, raising $14.6 billion combined. Circle opened at $31, touched $299, and settled at $57 — the volatility tells you the market doesn't know how to price these companies yet, which means the pricing discovery is early. The exit window opened, but through acquisitions and IPOs, not token launches.

That shift is structural.

Then there's the category rotation. Gaming and NFTs went from a significant share of crypto VC in 2022 to under 5% by H1 2025. Boryoku Dragonz to basis trades. Infrastructure and DeFi absorbed 75%. Stablecoin-specific funding went from $84 million in 2024 to $537 million. But here's what I didn't expect: 40 cents of every crypto VC dollar in 2025 went to companies also building AI, up from 18 cents the year before. The money isn't leaving crypto. It's following the settlement layer into adjacent markets — cross-border payments, agent infrastructure, treasury management.

And it's not just stablecoins. Uniswap processed $1 trillion in swap volume in 2025 — 915 million trades. Aave holds $43 billion in deposits and generated $885 million in protocol fees. Helium Mobile went from 200,000 users to 2 million in a year. These are businesses with revenue. Solana processed over $1 trillion in stablecoin volume — toly's prediction of $1 trillion in stablecoin supply by end of 2026 doesn't sound crazy when his own chain already settles that in volume.

Coinbase tells the same story from the inside. In 2020, 96% of revenue came from trading fees — back when Poloniex was still relevant and the trollbox was a memory. By 2025, subscription and services hit 41%, $2.9 billion annually. The largest driver is yield on USDC reserves. They're a bank that happens to run an exchange. Base did 299 million transactions a month and $82.6 million in revenue. Jesse Pollak: "We don't want to re-create the old systems with new tech." Q3 2025 revenue was $1.87 billion, up 55% year-over-year. They joined the S&P 500 in May.

So when I hear that crypto venture failed, I think about what actually happened. The speculation capital built infrastructure that's now being monetized through M&A, IPOs, subscription revenue, and Treasury yield — not the channels the speculators expected. The casino didn't fail. The house just changed ownership.

## Where It Matters Most

When the GENIUS Act passed — 68-30 in the Senate, signed July 2025 — it put the new order into law. Three tiers of stablecoin issuers: bank subsidiaries (unlimited), OCC-chartered nonbanks, and state-chartered issuers capped at $10 billion. Interest payments to holders prohibited. Yield goes to the issuer.

My first reading was doom — banks with 80 million customers just got permission to issue zero-cost deposits. But five OCC conditional charters went to crypto-native firms: BitGo, Circle, Fidelity Digital Assets, Paxos, Ripple. The compliance moat cuts both ways. And the domestic debate misses where the real usage is.

Stablecoin flows represent 6.7% of GDP in Africa and the Middle East. In North America, 0.4%. B2B stablecoin payments went from under $100 million a month in early 2023 to $6 billion a month by mid-2025. Argentina's crypto ownership hit 29.4%. Nigeria leads per capita globally. Moneygram launched stablecoin remittance in Colombia. A 1% reduction in remittance fees saves $23 billion per year globally. The BCH wars were about whether Bitcoin should be peer-to-peer electronic cash. Turns out it is — just denominated in USDT, running on Solana and Tron, not anything Satoshi built. Tether survives the bank invasion because it serves markets banks won't — Lagos, Istanbul, Buenos Aires. As Efayomi Carr put it: "In 2026, stablecoins will increasingly function as primary financial accounts in emerging markets."

Not a moat Wall Street can cross.

## Mars Gets an Atmosphere

In Kim Stanley Robinson's _Red Mars_, the colony splits between those who want Mars wild and those who want it habitable. The Greens win. Mars gets an atmosphere. The transnational corporations arrive with existing infrastructure and existing customers.

Huang's essay told the first half of this story. The casino built civilization. What happened next depends on which numbers you look at.

From one angle, absorption. Huang moved from writing about settlers to running a stablecoin payments company. Coinbase joined the S&P 500 and added stock trading, prediction markets, commodities. Circle's IPO was underwritten by the banks it will eventually compete with. Five crypto-native firms got OCC bank charters. The settlers who survived did it by becoming Earth companies.

But Robinson didn't account for one thing. AI agents need wallets. Visa launched a Trusted Agent Protocol. PayPal and OpenAI built Agent Checkout. The x402 protocol processed 15 million transactions. Non-human identities outnumber human employees 96-to-1 in finance — and they're unbanked. If autonomous agents become significant economic actors, crypto's programmable settlement is the only infrastructure that exists for them.

The question I can't resolve is whether the technology wins by disappearing. TCP/IP won by becoming invisible. Nobody thinks about it when they open a browser. But TCP/IP's creators captured none of the economic value. Patrick Collison called stablecoins "room-temperature superconductors for financial services." Sam Broner at a16z: "Stablecoins are already the best way to build a global fintech because they're fast, nearly free, and easily programmable." Nic Carter thinks we're a year or two from your deposits showing as generic "dollars" rather than USDC or USDT — stablecoins disappearing into the plumbing the way TCP/IP disappeared into the browser.

Our little corner of the internet became something else. The people who learned price discovery on the Grand Exchange and trust assumptions from rune armor scams built a $297 billion settlement layer that the S&P 500 runs on. The trollbox is gone. The pseudonyms stuck around — but now they're attached to OCC charters and Treasury exposure. Robinson's settlers didn't own Mars. Their legacy is that Mars has an atmosphere. Whether the people who built this keep ownership is still open — and I'm more optimistic about it than I was six months ago.

**Who wins:** Companies with compliance infrastructure and distribution — crypto-native or traditional. Tether in markets banks can't serve. Stablecoin issuers as mandatory Treasury demand ($1T in circulation = $1T in T-bill purchases). AI-crypto convergence builders. The 2023-vintage funds that bought the crash.

**Who's exposed:** 2021-vintage portfolios broadly (0.2% median IRR). Projects whose moat was technical understanding rather than distribution. Gaming and NFT plays riding the previous cycle.

**Prediction:** By Q4 2027, at least three top-ten US banks issue stablecoins through GENIUS Act subsidiaries, combined issuance exceeding $50 billion. Stablecoin annual transaction volume reaches $100 trillion. At least one AI agent payment protocol exceeds $1 billion in monthly volume.

**What proves me wrong:** Banks find stablecoin compliance uneconomical. DeFi composability creates a moat institutional products can't replicate. The CLARITY Act yield war kills the regulatory framework. AI agent payments remain vaporware — and the "next chapter" is a footnote. Or: the developing-world corridor proves worth more than the institutional market, and Tether becomes the most important financial company of the decade rather than a transitional player.
