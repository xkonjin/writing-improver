# Learning in Public: The Ex-Doctor's Playbook for Fintech Content Authority

## Deep Research Report — Comprehensive Strategy Guide

---

## 1. "Learning in Public" as a Content Strategy

### Origins and Philosophy

The concept was codified by **Shawn Wang (swyx)** in his essay ["Learn in Public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), which has been read by millions and became the foundational text for a movement. The expanded version appears in _The Coding Career Handbook_ (learninpublic.org).

**The core principle:** Create a habit of producing "learning exhaust" — visible artifacts of your learning journey rather than consuming privately. Make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning.

**Key rules from swyx:**

- Write blogs, tutorials, cheatsheets
- Speak at meetups and conferences
- Ask and answer things on StackOverflow or Reddit
- Make YouTube videos or Twitch streams
- Start a newsletter
- Draw cartoons (people love cartoons)
- "Don't judge your results by claps or retweets or stars or upvotes — just talk to yourself from 3 months ago"

### Why It Works: The Psychological Engine

**Vulnerability creates connection.** When you share what you don't know alongside what you're figuring out, you become relatable. Most content online is performative expertise. Learning in public is the opposite — it's intellectual honesty as a positioning strategy.

**Your audience grows WITH you.** People who discover you at month 2 of your journey become invested in your progression. They root for you. They share your wins. This creates a loyalty that polished expert content never achieves.

**The flywheel effect (from swyx):**

1. You learn publicly
2. Mentors notice and help (you amplify their work, they invest in you)
3. You answer community questions with increasing depth
4. You become the go-to person for a specific intersection
5. Compensation follows — "A lot more than you think"

### Successful Examples

| Creator                             | Model                                                            | Result                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shawn Wang (swyx)**               | Learned React/AWS in public via blog posts and talks             | Became a developer advocate, then AI startup founder  |
| **Rizel Scarlett (blackgirlbytes)** | Documented her dev journey publicly on DEV.to                    | Became a GitHub Developer Advocate                    |
| **Sahil Lavingia (Gumroad)**        | Shared detailed financial reports, pivot decisions, user metrics | Built massive trust and loyal user base               |
| **Buffer founders**                 | Published monthly revenue, struggles, internal decisions         | Pioneered "build in public" as a growth strategy      |
| **Felix (indie hacker)**            | Set yearly themes, shared progress on Twitter                    | Curated an engaged community around skill acquisition |

### Balancing "I'm Learning" with "I Have Authority"

This is the critical tension. The solution is **framing**:

**What NOT to do:** "I'm a total beginner and I just learned what a stablecoin is!"
**What TO do:** "I spent 8 hours reading Circle's reserve attestation reports. Here's what I found that nobody is talking about."

The difference: the second frame shows _intellectual rigor_ and _effort_ while still being transparent about the learning journey. You have authority not because you've been in the industry for 20 years, but because you did the work THIS WEEK that others didn't.

**The key distinction:** Learning in public is NOT just being a beginner. It's being a beginner who:

- Synthesizes information others haven't bothered to synthesize
- Brings a unique analytical framework (your medical training)
- Does the hard reading nobody else wants to do
- Connects dots between domains that insiders can't see
- Shows their reasoning, not just their conclusions

### First Principles Framing

First principles thinking — breaking complex ideas down to their fundamental truths and building back up — is a natural content framework for a career switcher. From [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/first-principles/): "If you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new."

**Why this works for fintech content:**

- Stablecoins, payments infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks are genuinely complex
- Most fintech content assumes insider knowledge and skips the "why"
- Building from basics creates content that serves a massive underserved audience: smart people who aren't in fintech yet
- The more complex the end explanation, the simpler the beginning should be
- Using narratives and analogies (especially medical ones) makes abstract concepts concrete

**Practical format:** "Stablecoins from First Principles" — start with "what is money?" and build to "why does Circle's reserve composition matter for institutional adoption?" This is content nobody in fintech writes because they've internalized the basics. You haven't, so you CAN.

## 2. Career Switcher Narrative Power

### Why "Ex-Doctor Learning Fintech" Is a Compelling Hook

This works on multiple levels:

**Pattern interrupt.** In a sea of "Growth Marketing Manager shares 5 tips," the words "Ex-Doctor" stop the scroll. It's unexpected. It creates a gap ("wait, why did a doctor leave medicine?") that demands resolution.

**Status arbitrage.** Doctors carry enormous cultural credibility. When a doctor says "I left medicine to pursue this," the implicit message is: "This field is so important/interesting that someone who could save lives chose it instead." That signals to readers that fintech/stablecoins matter.

**Built-in narrative arc.** Every piece of content sits within a larger story: the journey from medicine to fintech. This gives your audience a reason to follow over time, not just read one post.

### The Outsider Advantage

From [Chief Executive](https://chiefexecutive.net/the-outsiders-advantage-how-fresh-eyes-beat-deep-experience/), Aaron Patzer (Mint founder) argues: "Industry insiders can't see past industry constraints. They know too much about why things don't work to imagine how they could work differently."

**Applied to your situation:**

1. **No jargon blindness.** You don't default to acronyms and insider language. When you explain something, you explain it for humans. This is a superpower in an industry drowning in TLAs (three-letter acronyms).

2. **Asking "dumb" questions.** Outsiders are more comfortable asking fundamental questions that reveal creative possibilities experts dismiss. "Why do cross-border payments still take 3 days?" is a question insiders stopped asking. You haven't.

3. **Fresh pattern recognition.** You see connections between fintech and healthcare that lifers in either industry miss. Payment processing issues mirror healthcare billing complexity. Regulatory compliance in stablecoins parallels pharmaceutical approval processes.

4. **Lower defensive walls.** Industry veterans stop asking questions because "it's always been this way" or "regulations require it." Most of the time, neither is entirely true. You don't carry that baggage.

### The Medical Framework as Analytical Superpower

The medical diagnostic framework maps directly to business and market analysis:

| Medical Process             | Business Application            | Content Angle                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Patient History**         | Market/company context analysis | "The patient history of stablecoin regulation"                                |
| **Differential Diagnosis**  | Evaluating competing hypotheses | "Three possible diagnoses for why PayPal's stablecoin isn't gaining traction" |
| **Diagnostic Testing**      | Data analysis, research         | "The lab results are in: what Q4 stablecoin volumes actually tell us"         |
| **Treatment Plan**          | Strategic recommendations       | "Prescribing a growth strategy for stablecoin adoption"                       |
| **Monitoring/Follow-up**    | Tracking outcomes, iteration    | "6-month follow-up: was the prognosis correct?"                               |
| **Evidence-Based Medicine** | Data-driven decision making     | "What the evidence says about stablecoin yield products"                      |
| **Triage**                  | Prioritization frameworks       | "Triaging the stablecoin regulatory landscape: what matters most right now"   |

This isn't gimmicky — it's genuinely how doctors think, and it's a rigorous analytical framework that applies beautifully to market analysis.

### Other Career Switchers Who Built Audiences

- **Investment banker to YouTuber:** Quit two months before a six-figure bonus, now has 1M+ subscribers and earns $1M+ from content about personal finance. The financial knowledge became the foundation of credibility.
- **Wall Street to TikTok:** Posted first vlog in May 2022, built audience by translating complex financial concepts for regular people.
- **Tech recruiter to content creator:** Leveraged insider hiring knowledge to create negotiation and career content.
- **Career-lifestyle creators** are a rapidly growing segment mixing professional expertise (product management, law, engineering, finance) with learning narrative.

### The "Translation" Superpower

Your biggest content advantage: **explaining complex fintech to normal humans.** Most fintech content is written by insiders for insiders. The audience that actually needs clear explanations — operators at non-fintech companies evaluating stablecoin payments, CFOs considering treasury diversification, marketers at fintech companies who need to understand the product — is massive and underserved.

Medical training specifically teaches you to translate complex information for patients. This is exactly the same skill applied to a different domain.

### Building Credibility Through Intellectual Honesty

From the research on intellectual honesty: acknowledging what you don't know is perceived as weakness but is actually a catalyst for credibility. The key is combining honesty about your learning journey with demonstrable rigor in how you learn.

**The formula:** "I don't have 10 years in fintech. What I have is the discipline to read primary sources, the analytical training to evaluate them, and the communication skills to explain what I find."

## 3. Niche Positioning Strategies

### The Intersection: Fintech + Stablecoins + Growth Marketing

You're not just "in fintech." You're at a specific intersection that almost nobody occupies:

```
[Medical Analytical Training]
        ×
[Stablecoin/Payments Expertise (growing)]
        ×
[Growth Marketing Execution]
        ×
[Learning-in-Public Transparency]
```

This is a **category of one.** Nobody else has this exact combination, which means you don't compete — you exist in a space others can't occupy.

### The "Category of One" Concept

From positioning theory: rather than competing within an existing category, you create a new one that you own by definition. The key insight is that your unique background IS your positioning. You don't need to be the best at any single dimension — you need to be the only person at that specific intersection.

**Test:** Can anyone else accurately claim to be "an ex-doctor applying medical diagnostic frameworks to analyze stablecoin market dynamics while building growth marketing systems at a stablecoin company"? No. That's your category.

### April Dunford's Framework Applied to Personal Brand

From [Obviously Awesome](https://www.aprildunford.com/books), Dunford's positioning process asks five questions. Applied to your personal brand:

1. **Competitive Alternatives:** What would your audience follow/read if you didn't exist?
   - Generic fintech newsletters (The Fintech Times, Fintech Weekly)
   - Crypto Twitter hot takes
   - Consulting firm reports (McKinsey, BCG fintech practice)
   - Your answer: You exist in the gap between "too technical/insider" and "too shallow/hype-driven"

2. **Unique Attributes:** What do you have that alternatives don't?
   - Medical analytical training applied to fintech
   - Insider access at a stablecoin company
   - Growth marketing practitioner perspective (not just theory)
   - Career-switcher vulnerability and learning arc
   - Anti-slop commitment to depth and clarity

3. **Value:** What value do those attributes create for the audience?
   - Complex topics made genuinely understandable
   - Actionable insights for operators, not just investors
   - Honest assessment (not shilling tokens)
   - The satisfaction of following a compelling journey

4. **Target Audience Characteristics:** Who cares most about this value?
   - Fintech operators and marketers (not developers)
   - Career switchers considering fintech
   - Non-crypto people who need to understand stablecoins
   - Growth marketers at crypto/fintech companies
   - Executives evaluating stablecoin integration

5. **Market Category:** What's the market frame that makes your value obvious?
   - "The operator's guide to stablecoins" or "Stablecoins for people who actually build things"

### Differentiating from Generic Fintech Content

The fintech content landscape has three problems you can exploit:

1. **Insider jargon problem:** Most content assumes you know what an L2, a PSP, or an FBO account is. You can be the translator.
2. **Hype vs. substance problem:** Crypto content skews heavily toward price speculation and hype. Stablecoin infrastructure content — the boring, important stuff — is radically undersupplied.
3. **Theory vs. practice problem:** Consultants write about fintech strategy. You're actually DOING growth marketing at a stablecoin company. Practitioner content always beats theory.

### The "Anti-Slop" Positioning

"Slop" was selected as Merriam-Webster's 2025 Word of the Year. From [The Writer](https://www.thewriter.com/blog/stop-the-slop-how-to-write-online-in-2025): AI slop is "low quality, inauthentic, or inaccurate" content produced in high volume for clicks.

**The anti-slop positioning is explicit:**

- "I read the primary source so you don't have to" (SEC filings, Federal Reserve papers, company attestation reports)
- Original research and analysis, not regurgitated press releases
- Specific, niche audience targeting instead of lowest-common-denominator content
- Personal authenticity and perspective that "can't be coughed up by machines"
- "The bar is shifting from 'can you create?' to 'can you make something that only YOU could create?'"

**Make this explicit in your bio and content.** In an era of AI slop, being demonstrably human and rigorous is a competitive moat.

### Audience Definition: Who Shares This in Company Slack?

Be precise about your ideal reader. These are the people who would DM your post to a colleague:

| Audience Segment                                            | Why They Share                                                            | What They Need                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fintech marketers**                                       | "Finally someone explains stablecoins in a way I can use for positioning" | Clear frameworks for messaging complex products     |
| **Growth operators at crypto companies**                    | "This person actually does what we do, not just tweets about it"          | Tactical growth playbooks with real numbers         |
| **Non-crypto executives evaluating stablecoin integration** | "I need to understand this for the board meeting"                         | First-principles explanations with business context |
| **Career switchers into fintech**                           | "This person proves it's possible and shows the path"                     | Encouragement + practical guidance                  |
| **Other content creators**                                  | "This is how you do learning-in-public well"                              | Inspiration and format ideas                        |

## 4. Building Authority While Learning

### The Synthesis Model

This is your primary content engine. The formula:

**Read 10 sources. Synthesize one clear insight.**

You don't need to be the person who discovers new information. You need to be the person who:

1. Finds the 10 most important things written about a topic this week
2. Actually reads them (most people don't)
3. Identifies the pattern, contradiction, or insight across them
4. Explains it clearly in your own words with your unique analytical frame

**Example:** Read Circle's Q4 attestation, Tether's reserve disclosure, the Federal Reserve's stablecoin working paper, three analyst reports, and two regulatory filings. Synthesize into: "Here's what nobody is connecting: the reserve composition shift at the top 3 stablecoin issuers and why it signals X for enterprise adoption."

### Curation as Content

From the research on [content curation and authority](https://beomniscient.com/blog/content-curation/): becoming a curator of great ideas through a newsletter makes you "the person who spots and shares interesting, relevant content from across the internet." Over time, people begin viewing you as an expert who can spot trends before they become popular.

**Rohit Bhargava's Five Models of Content Curation:**

1. **Aggregation:** Gathering the most relevant information in one place
2. **Distillation:** Filtering to only share what's truly valuable
3. **Elevation:** Recognizing a larger trend from individual data points
4. **Mashup:** Combining sources to create a new perspective
5. **Chronology:** Organizing information over time to show evolution

For your positioning, **Elevation** and **Mashup** are the highest-value models. You're not just sharing links — you're identifying what they mean together.

### The "I Read the [Dense Thing] So You Don't Have To" Format

This is a signature content format waiting to be claimed in the stablecoin space:

- "I read the GENIUS Act so you don't have to" (the Senate's stablecoin regulation bill)
- "I read Circle's S-1 filing so you don't have to"
- "I read all 47 pages of the Fed's stablecoin paper so you don't have to"
- "I read Stripe's stablecoin API documentation so you don't have to"

**Why this works:** It's an immediate, clear value proposition. The audience knows exactly what they're getting. The implicit message is: "I did the boring, hard work of reading the primary source, and I'm going to give you the good parts." This is authority through effort, not credentials.

### Interview/Conversation-Based Content to Borrow Authority

From the podcast research: "Having a guest on your show can raise your own level of authority." For a new creator, conversations are a cheat code.

**Tactical approach:**

- You work at a stablecoin company. You have access to people in the industry.
- Start with "informal conversations" posted on LinkedIn or a newsletter, not a formal podcast
- Interview format lets you ask the smart questions (your outsider advantage) while your guest provides the deep expertise
- After recording, repurpose: clips for LinkedIn, quotes for Twitter/X, full conversation for newsletter
- Each guest amplifies your content to their network

**Who to interview first:** Your own colleagues (with company approval), other fintech marketers, stablecoin analysts, payments infrastructure builders, regulatory experts.

### Progression Arc

| Timeline         | Content Depth                                                                      | Authority Level                                            | Format Focus                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Months 1-3**   | First principles explainers, "what I learned this week," industry glossary content | "Smart beginner sharing the journey"                       | LinkedIn posts, short newsletter issues                       |
| **Months 4-6**   | Deeper analysis, regulatory breakdowns, market comparisons                         | "Informed practitioner with unique perspective"            | Longer newsletter essays, data-backed LinkedIn posts          |
| **Months 7-9**   | Original frameworks, prediction posts, company/product analysis                    | "Emerging voice with a specific lens"                      | Newsletter as primary, LinkedIn for distribution              |
| **Months 10-12** | Industry commentary, invited conversations, opinion pieces                         | "Go-to person for stablecoins-meets-marketing perspective" | Speaking invitations, guest posts, cross-publication features |

### Handling Being Wrong Publicly

From swyx: "Try your best to be right, but don't worry when you're wrong. Repeatedly."

**Turn mistakes into content:**

1. **The correction post:** "Last month I wrote X. Here's why I was wrong, and what I've learned since." This is some of the most engaging content possible because it demonstrates intellectual honesty.
2. **The post-mortem:** "I predicted Y would happen with stablecoin regulation. Z happened instead. Here's my updated mental model."
3. **The evolution thread:** "My thinking on [topic] has changed. Here's the timeline of how and why."

Being wrong publicly and owning it builds more trust than being right quietly. Richard Branson has publicly attributed significant achievements to his willingness to recognize errors, viewing failures as essential components of learning.

## 5. Personal Brand Architecture

### Bio/Headline Formulas for LinkedIn

From the research on [LinkedIn headlines for career changers](https://career.io/career-advice/use-linkedin-headline-for-career-change), the most effective formula is: **[Identity] | [What You Do] | [Unique Value/Angle]**

**Recommended headline options:**

Option A (story-forward):

```
Ex-Doctor Turned Fintech Marketer | Learning Stablecoins in Public | Growth @ Plasma
```

Option B (value-forward):

```
Growth Marketing @ Plasma | Making Stablecoins Make Sense | Ex-Physician Bringing Fresh Eyes to Fintech
```

Option C (audience-forward):

```
Explaining Stablecoins for People Who Build Things | Growth @ Plasma | Former Physician
```

Option D (positioning-forward):

```
The Doctor Who Prescribes Stablecoin Strategy | Growth Marketing @ Plasma
```

**Key principles:**

- Lead with the pattern interrupt (ex-doctor/physician)
- Include your current role for credibility anchor
- Signal the content angle (learning in public, making things make sense)
- The first 150 characters matter most (that's what shows in search results)

### "About" Section Strategy

Structure the About section as a **narrative arc**, not a resume:

```
The hook (2 sentences):
"I left medicine to figure out why stablecoins might be the most important
financial innovation of the decade. Now I'm learning in public while
building growth systems at Plasma."

The bridge (2-3 sentences):
"My medical training taught me to diagnose problems by going to primary
sources, asking fundamental questions, and following evidence wherever
it leads. Turns out, that's exactly what fintech needs more of."

The value proposition (2-3 sentences):
"Every week, I read the dense stuff — regulatory filings, reserve
attestations, infrastructure documentation — and translate it into clear
analysis for operators and builders. No jargon. No hype. Just signal."

The invitation (1-2 sentences):
"Follow along if you want stablecoin insights that actually make sense,
or if you're curious what happens when a doctor diagnoses fintech.
Newsletter: [link]"
```

### Content Pillars Framework (3-5 Recurring Themes)

Every piece of content should fit into one of these pillars:

**Pillar 1: Stablecoin Intelligence** (40% of content)

- Regulatory analysis and breakdowns
- Market data and trends
- Company and product analysis
- "I read it so you don't have to" format
- _Example:_ "The GENIUS Act explained: what stablecoin companies actually need to do by 2027"

**Pillar 2: Growth Marketing in Fintech** (25% of content)

- Tactical growth playbooks
- Marketing challenges specific to crypto/fintech
- Case studies from Plasma and industry
- Messaging and positioning for complex products
- _Example:_ "How do you market a product most people don't understand yet? Lessons from month 4 at a stablecoin company"

**Pillar 3: The Career Switcher Journey** (20% of content)

- Learning-in-public updates
- "What I got wrong" and evolution posts
- Medical-to-fintech framework translations
- Advice for other career switchers
- _Example:_ "What ER triage taught me about prioritizing marketing experiments"

**Pillar 4: The Anti-Slop Manifesto** (10% of content)

- Meta-content about content quality
- Original research methodology
- Critiques of hype and shallow analysis
- Writing and thinking process
- _Example:_ "Why I read 47-page regulatory filings instead of waiting for the Twitter summary"

**Pillar 5: Industry Connections** (5% of content)

- Interview highlights and conversations
- Community spotlights
- Event takeaways
- _Example:_ "3 things I learned talking to [name] about stablecoin treasury management"

### Signature Formats (What You Become Known For)

Choose 2-3 formats and repeat them until they become associated with your name:

1. **"The Diagnosis"** — Apply the medical diagnosis framework to a fintech topic. Patient history, differential diagnosis, recommended treatment, prognosis. This is your most unique format.

2. **"I Read It So You Don't Have To"** — Dense source material (regulatory filing, earnings call transcript, technical whitepaper) distilled into clear takeaways. Always link to the source.

3. **"First Principles: [Topic]"** — Build understanding of a complex topic from absolute zero. These become evergreen reference content.

4. **"Week in Stablecoins"** — Weekly newsletter format curating and analyzing the most important developments. Elevation + Distillation curation model.

5. **"What I Got Wrong"** — Periodic honesty posts revisiting previous analysis. The vulnerability format that builds the most trust.

### Cross-Platform Strategy

**LinkedIn (primary platform, daily):**

- Home base for professional credibility
- 3-5 posts per week
- Mix of short insights (150-300 words) and longer analysis (600-1200 words)
- Strategic commenting: 3-5 thoughtful comments per day on relevant posts
- Drive newsletter signups with every substantial post

**Newsletter (weekly, core asset):**

- The "hub" of the hub-and-spoke model
- Owned audience (not dependent on algorithm)
- Longer-form analysis, weekly curation, signature formats
- 1 issue per week, consistently
- Platform: Substack or Beehiiv (both have discovery features)

**Twitter/X (supplementary, 2-3x per week):**

- Threads summarizing newsletter content
- Real-time reactions to stablecoin news
- Engaging with fintech/crypto community
- Shorter, punchier takes

**Repurposing flow:**

```
Newsletter (long-form) → LinkedIn post (key insight) → Twitter thread (compressed) → LinkedIn comments (engagement on related posts)
```

### Community Building Around the Learning Journey

- **Invite readers into the process:** "I'm researching X next week. What questions should I be asking?"
- **Create accountability:** Monthly "learning log" posts sharing what you studied
- **Spotlight your readers:** Share questions from subscribers and answer them publicly
- **Build a small circle:** Identify 10-20 other people learning in public in adjacent spaces and actively engage with their content

## 6. Distribution and Growth Tactics for New Creators

### First 1,000 Subscribers Strategy

From the [newsletter growth research](https://growthgurukul.in/building-a-newsletter-from-0-to-1000-subscribers/), here's a realistic timeline:

**Month 1 (Target: 30-50 subscribers)**

- Personal network outreach to 50 contacts
- LinkedIn announcement post about the newsletter
- Add newsletter link to LinkedIn profile, email signature, everywhere
- Publish first 4 issues to build an archive

**Months 2-3 (Target: 150-250 subscribers)**

- LinkedIn content machine: 3-5 posts per week, each with a newsletter CTA
- Cross-promotion with 2-3 similar newsletters
- Engage in relevant LinkedIn and Reddit communities
- Create a lead magnet (stablecoin glossary, "What is a stablecoin?" explainer)

**Months 4-6 (Target: 400-600 subscribers)**

- Guest features in established newsletters
- LinkedIn newsletter feature (built-in subscriber notifications)
- 2-3 podcast/interview appearances
- Referral program implementation
- First viral post attempt (data-driven analysis piece)

**Months 7-12 (Target: 1,000+ subscribers)**

- Newsletter swap partnerships (5-10 collaborations)
- Content repurposing into other formats (short video, carousel)
- Speaking at virtual events or Twitter Spaces
- Optional small paid promotion budget ($100-200)

**Critical stat:** 60% of newsletter growth comes from outside your own network. Partnerships, guest features, and community participation matter more than your existing contacts.

### LinkedIn to Newsletter Funnel

This is your primary growth engine. The architecture:

```
LinkedIn Post (insight/hook)
    ↓
"I go deeper on this in my newsletter" CTA
    ↓
Newsletter Landing Page
    ↓
Welcome Email (sets expectations, delivers value immediately)
    ↓
Weekly Newsletter
    ↓
Most engaged readers → share on LinkedIn → cycle repeats
```

**Keys to conversion:**

- Every LinkedIn post should stand alone as valuable, not just be a teaser
- The newsletter CTA should promise ADDITIONAL value, not the same content
- Conversion rates increase 40-60% when users encounter your brand across multiple touchpoints

### Strategic Commenting and Engagement

From the [LinkedIn commenting research](https://louisebrogan.com/linkedin-comments/):

**The numbers:** Users who comment strategically 5-10 times a day see a 55% increase in profile views and 20% more reach on their own content. LinkedIn comments increased 37% year-over-year in 2025.

**Your commenting strategy:**

1. Identify 20-30 accounts in fintech/stablecoins/payments/growth marketing that post regularly
2. Set aside 20 minutes each morning for strategic commenting
3. Every comment should add a new insight, ask a genuine question, or provide a specific example
4. Never: "Great post!" Always: substantive contribution showing your unique perspective
5. Comments must exceed 10 words to receive algorithmic weight
6. Engage during the "golden hour" — first 60 minutes after a post goes live

**Who to comment on:**

- Fintech executives and founders
- Stablecoin company leaders
- Payments infrastructure builders
- Growth marketing practitioners
- Fintech journalists and analysts
- Regulatory commentators

### Collaboration and Cross-Promotion

- **Newsletter swaps:** Find 5 newsletters in adjacent niches (fintech, crypto, growth marketing, career change) and propose mutual recommendations
- **LinkedIn collaborations:** Co-author posts with colleagues or industry contacts
- **"Interview swap" format:** You interview them for your newsletter, they mention you in theirs
- **Community contribution:** Write guest posts for fintech publications (The Fintech Times, Fintech Weekly, industry Substack publications)

### Using Your Day Job as a Content Engine

This is your unfair advantage. You work at Plasma, a stablecoin company. This means:

**What you CAN share (with company approval):**

- Your perspective on industry trends (clearly labeled as personal views)
- Lessons learned from marketing a complex product
- Frameworks you've developed for explaining stablecoins
- Your growth marketing experiments (anonymized if needed)
- What it's like working at a stablecoin company day-to-day
- Conference takeaways and industry event insights

**What you SHOULD NOT share:**

- Proprietary company data or unreleased plans
- Specific customer information
- Internal communications
- Anything that could be considered insider information

**The meta-content opportunity:** "Building in public at a stablecoin company" is inherently interesting content. The transparency about what it's like to market stablecoins — the challenges, the misconceptions you encounter, the creative solutions — is content nobody else is creating.

### Niche Newsletter Advantage

From the data: niche newsletters see 27% faster audience growth versus general-interest, and earn 2-3x more than generalist competitors. Finance and investing newsletters show 40-45% open rates with highest growth velocity.

Your niche — the intersection of stablecoins, growth marketing, and the career-switcher learning journey — is narrow enough to be differentiated and broad enough to sustain a real audience.

## 7. Industry Context: Why NOW for Stablecoin Content

### The Stablecoin Moment (2025-2026)

The timing for stablecoin-focused content is exceptional:

- **Transaction volumes** rose from hundreds of billions to more than $700 billion monthly
- **VC investment** in stablecoin companies exceeded $1.5 billion in 2025 (up from $50M in 2019)
- The **GENIUS Act** passed the US Senate, creating the first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins
- Industry analysts project stablecoin circulation to **exceed $1 trillion by 2026**
- "In the next few years, every fintech company will, in effect, be a stablecoin company"
- Leading enterprises will use stablecoin funding alongside global payout networks for treasury optimization and cross-border settlement
- Stablecoins are becoming **"the internet's dollar"**

**Content implication:** There is a massive wave of people — executives, operators, marketers, investors — who NEED to understand stablecoins and currently don't. The educational content gap is enormous. Being the clear, rigorous voice that fills this gap right now is a timing opportunity that won't last forever.

### Regulatory Complexity = Content Opportunity

The GENIUS Act creates significant regulatory complexity:

- Only permitted entities (licensed depository institutions, OCC-approved nonbanks) can issue stablecoins
- 1:1 reserve backing required in short-term treasuries or currency
- Monthly reserve composition disclosure mandated
- KYC/AML compliance required
- Takes effect January 2027

Every one of these requirements is a content opportunity. Someone needs to explain what this means for different types of companies, what compliance looks like, and how the landscape will shift. That someone can be you.
