## Part 3: The Human Voice Test

### Read Aloud Protocol

2. "What action should you take?"
3. "What confused you?"
4. "What was most interesting?"
5. "Would you share this?"

## Part 5: Insight Density Analysis

### Value Per Minute Calculator

```
Word Count: ___
Reading Time: ___ minutes (words ÷ 250)

Insights Delivered:
1. _________________ (Novel? Y/N)
2. _________________ (Novel? Y/N)
3. _________________ (Novel? Y/N)
4. _________________ (Novel? Y/N)
5. _________________ (Novel? Y/N)

Insight Density = Novel Insights / Reading Minutes
Target: >1.0 insight per minute
```

### The "So What?" Test

After each paragraph, write the value:

- Paragraph 1: So what? ****\_\_\_****
- Paragraph 2: So what? ****\_\_\_****
- Paragraph 3: So what? ****\_\_\_****

If answer is "nothing" → DELETE
If answer is "context" → MOVE TO APPENDIX
If answer is "insight" → KEEP AND STRENGTHEN

## Part 6: Cognitive Load Assessment

### Complexity Audit

#### Per Paragraph:

- New concepts introduced: \_\_\_ (max: 2)
- Jargon terms: \_\_\_ (max: 1)
- References requiring context: \_\_\_ (max: 1)
- Ideas per sentence: \_\_\_ (max: 1.5)

#### Red Zones:

- 3+ concepts in one paragraph
- 2+ jargon terms without definition
- Sentences with multiple clauses
- Paragraphs over 150 words
- Abstractions without examples

### Simplification Opportunities

Look for:

1. **Jargon → Plain English**
   - "Utilize" → "Use"
   - "Implement" → "Start"
   - "Leverage" → "Use"

2. **Passive → Active**
   - "Was decided by the team" → "The team decided"
   - "Is believed to be" → "I believe"

3. **Abstract → Concrete**
   - "Significant growth" → "40% increase"
   - "In the near future" → "By March 2025"
   - "Multiple stakeholders" → "Sales, marketing, and product teams"

## Part 7: Structure & Flow Analysis

### Opening Hook Evaluation

Rate your opening (1-10):

- [ ] Surprises reader
- [ ] Makes clear promise
- [ ] Creates curiosity
- [ ] Personal connection
- [ ] Immediate value

**Score below 7? Rewrite opening.**

### Flow Mapping

Map your essay:

```
Opening: [Core question/hook]
    ↓
Section 1: [Main point] → Evidence: ___
    ↓
Section 2: [Main point] → Evidence: ___
    ↓
Section 3: [Main point] → Evidence: ___
    ↓
Conclusion: [Call to action/insight]
```

Check:

- Does each section advance the argument?
- Could sections be reordered?
- Any redundant points?
- Clear logical progression?

### Transition Audit

Between each paragraph:

- Invisible transition (best)
- Logical connector ("because", "since")
- Unique transition
- Generic transition (worst)

Count each type. Aim for 50%+ invisible transitions.

## Part 8: Memorability Check

### The 24-Hour Test

After reading, reader should remember:

1. **One Big Idea**: Can you state it in <10 words?
2. **One Specific Example**: What story/data point sticks?
3. **One Actionable Takeaway**: What should they do?

If missing any element, strengthen that aspect.

### Quotability Audit

Find your most quotable lines:

1. **********\_\_\_********** (≤10 words)
2. **********\_\_\_********** (≤10 words)
3. **********\_\_\_********** (≤10 words)

No quotable lines? Add:

- Compressed insight
- Provocative claim
- Memorable metaphor
- Rhythmic phrase

---

## Part 9: Final Polish Checklist

- [ ] Remove every "that" possible
- [ ] Delete "I think" / "I believe"

- [ ] Add specific numbers
- [ ] Insert surprising detail
- [ ] Include contrarian moment
- [ ] Add personal stake/vulnerability

#### Voice Check

## Part 10: The Publishability Matrix

### Decision Framework

| Clarity | Insight | Voice | Action                     |
| ------- | ------- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| High    | High    | High  | **PUBLISH NOW**            |
| High    | High    | Low   | Polish voice, then publish |
| High    | Low     | High  | Add research/insight       |
| Low     | High    | High  | Clarify structure          |
| High    | Low     | Low   | Maybe wrong format         |
| Low     | High    | Low   | Major rewrite needed       |
| Low     | Low     | High  | Wrong topic for you        |
| Low     | Low     | Low   | **START OVER**             |

## Quick Quality Score

### The 5-Minute Assessment

1. **Hook Power**: \_/10
2. **Insight Density**: \_/10
3. **Voice Distinctiveness**: \_/10
4. **Clarity**: \_/10
5. **Actionability**: \_/10

**Total: \_/50**

- **40+**: Ship it
- **30-39**: One more edit
- **20-29**: Significant revision
- **<20**: Fundamental rethink

---

## The Ultimate Question

**Would you eagerly send this to someone you respect?**

If hesitant, identify why:

- Not clear enough?
- Not insightful enough?
- Not "you" enough?
- Not useful enough?

Fix that. Then publish.

---

## Remember

Quality isn't about perfection.
It's about respect for the reader's time.

Every word they read is a moment of their life.
Make it worth it.

Ship when proud, not when perfect.
