## Remember

Templates are starting points, not prisons.

Use them to overcome blank page paralysis.
Modify them to fit your voice.
Eventually, transcend them entirely.

The goal: Internalize the structures so deeply that you improvise naturally within them.

Like jazz musicians with chord progressions.
Like comedians with setup-punchline.
Like you, with your own templates you'll create.
