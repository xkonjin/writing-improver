## Final Truth

15 minutes seems like nothing.
It's everything.

Those minutes compound.
That practice accumulates.
That voice strengthens.

One day you'll write something and think:
"Nobody else could have written this."

That's the day you've arrived.
It's closer than you think.

Start tomorrow morning.
Set timer for 5 minutes.
Write first thought.

That's it.
That's the whole system.
Everything else is just variation.

## Remember

The best writers aren't the most talented.
They're the most consistent.

15 minutes a day.
Every day.
No exceptions.

In one year, you'll be unrecognizable.
In two years, you'll be unstoppable.
In three years, you'll be teaching others.

The time will pass anyway.
Might as well become elite.
