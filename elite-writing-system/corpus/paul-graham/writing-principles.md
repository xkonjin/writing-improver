# Paul Graham's Writing Principles

## Core Philosophy

> "Write Like You Talk" - But impossibly perfectly

Paul Graham's writing appears simple but employs sophisticated rhetorical techniques beneath the surface.

## Key Principles from PG's Essays

### 1. The "Loose Then Tight" Method

- Write first draft quickly
- Spend significant time rewriting
- Proofread 100+ times per sentence if needed
- "The difference between good writing and bad writing is revision"

### 2. Useful Writing Formula

**Usefulness = Correctness × Importance × Novelty × Strength**

- **Correctness**: Make claims as strong as possible without becoming false
- **Importance**: Impact multiplied by audience size
- **Novelty**: Tell people something they don't already know
- **Strength**: Confident but carefully qualified statements

### 3. Conversational Elevation

- Write in conversational tone
- But make it impossibly perfect
- Use rhythm and flow of speech
- Elevate without pretension

### 4. The Plain Style with Sophistication

- Simple vocabulary hiding complex structure
- Rhetorical repetitions and refinements
- Small point by small point persuasion
- Silver chain of connected sentences

### 5. Strategic Eloquence

- Deploy fancy language sparingly
- Occasional flash rewards attention
- Too much becomes pretentious
- Balance simplicity with moments of beauty

## Writing Process

### Starting

1. Write about narrow topics you're expert in
2. Use yourself as proxy for reader interest
3. Only write about deeply-considered topics

### Drafting

1. Get ideas down quickly
2. Don't worry about perfection initially
3. Focus on capturing insights

### Revising

1. Rewrite extensively
2. Read aloud to test flow
3. Delete anything you're not confident about
4. Simplify language continuously

### Publishing

1. Only publish when completely confident
2. Be willing to abandon pieces
3. Quality over quantity

## Signature Techniques

### Sentence Construction

- Vary sentence length
- Create rhythm through repetition
- Build arguments incrementally
- Use transitions as logical connectors

### Paragraph Flow

- One main idea per paragraph
- Clear topic sentences
- Supporting evidence follows
- Smooth transitions between ideas

### Essay Architecture

- Start with intriguing question
- Build through exploration
- Arrive at unexpected insights
- Leave reader with new perspective

## Common Patterns in PG Essays

### Opening Moves

- Counterintuitive observation
- Personal anecdote with broader implications
- Question that challenges assumptions
- Historical parallel to modern situation

### Development Strategies

- First principles reasoning
- Analogies from different fields
- Personal experience as evidence
- Mathematical or logical proofs

### Closing Techniques

- Synthesis of disparate ideas
- Call to action
- Prediction about future
- Return to opening with new understanding

## What to Avoid

- Unnecessary complexity
- Hedge words that weaken arguments
- Generic examples
- Abstract concepts without concrete illustrations
- Writing to impress rather than communicate

## Key Quotes

> "The test of a good essay is whether someone who reads it and has never thought about its topic much could write something interesting about it after reading you."

> "Write for a reader who won't read the essay as carefully as you hope."

> "If you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said."

> "Expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it."

## Application Exercise

Take any complex idea and:

1. Explain it conversationally
2. Remove all jargon
3. Add one surprising insight
4. Revise until every word is necessary
5. Read aloud and adjust rhythm

This captures the essence of PG's approach: apparent simplicity masking sophisticated thought, delivered with conversational clarity.
